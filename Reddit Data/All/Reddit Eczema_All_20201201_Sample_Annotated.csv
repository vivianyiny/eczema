In desperation he goes to Aslan (if you're not familiar with the series he's a talking lion who is, for all intents and purposes, magical Jesus) and begs to be turned back. Aslan says fine, but it's going to hurt, and then proceeds to use his lion claws to literally tear the dragon skin off of him until there's just the boy left, and he runs back to his friends feeling fresh and clean, a changed man.

The whole thing is meant to be an allegory for how self-examination and genuine self-improvement is painful but ultimately worthwhile, but little eczema-having-me just fixated on the idea of peeling off scaly skin to reveal fresh, healthy pink skin underneath (which is how it's described in the book) and how *good* it would feel.

Whirle,"it honestly feels like hot itchy fire. I cant offer much in suggestions because think it may differ but, it might help to know this little bit of info. Whenever you have a spot that has been scratched at and you put a lotion or cream sometimes that makes it SO much worse feeling, like 1000x worse. Especially being 4 and not knowing that it is just the cream trying to help. I guess you could spot test some different creams and ask him if it makes it worse or better immediately after. Something like vasaline doesn't usually hurt for me personally. Even being 31 years old and having it most of my life Its so hard to explain why I CANT stop scratching. I usually don't even know I'm doing it. Ive tried everything short of the injections.

I know for the spots on the tops of my feet/ankles legs I wear compression knee socks at night to prevent scratching. I know for kids they make those socks with grips on the inside to make it way harder for them to pull off. you could try those maybe! Hell i might even need to try those lol. sorry you have to deal with this.",R

ausschweifung,"I've been having similar problems lately and that's even with ongoing Dupixent injections.

Realistically for your work, I think it's just something you have to make clear to your peers, your manager, and in many cases, HR, about. My doctor (who is also a university researcher) wrote a very long letter on my behalf to explain the condition, the mental health aspects of managing the symptoms, and suggested work arrangements (remote work in my case, since I work in tech). I know it's embarrassing, but people are generally sympathetic and want you to be able to be most productive in spite of your condition instead of miserably forced to perform at a subpar level.

As far as products go, I would actually do a hard reset on your skin. Just do water and medicated ointment (creams and lotions do not retain moisture for as long and requires reapplication more frequently), as well as frequent changes of pillow cases and towels. Hopefully you have access to Elidel (for mild cases) or Protopic (for moderate to severe cases which from your photos actually fit in that category). 

Once you feel your skin barrier is stronger, I'd use something that's rigorously tested for allergens by dermatologists. I've been using Mustela Steletopia emollient cream and Clinique Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion. These two by far are the most absorbent and doesn't feel caked on, so it's comfortable on your skin and you can apply frequently throughout the day.

Lastly I'd suggest is to just find friends and hang out, explain you're not having a good time and their company would lighten you up. Stress really does steer eczema for the worse.

Second of all, I would talk to your doctor about tacrolimus or pimecrolimus cream, if you haven't already. They're expensive but you look like you're in pain and if you can't tolerate steroids then you have limited options. 

Then I'd talk to them about how to prevent this from happening again. This will eventually clear up and you'll want to stay cleared up! I do bleach baths every week and use tons of Cerave and Nivea.

You can apply the tea tree by soaking a towel first and patting it on to avoid over-doing it (it can be over-drying if used in large amounts).

Raveynfyre,"Personally, for me it's anywhere from 1-3 days and takes at least a week to resolve the outbreak (minimum).

Have you tried cutting MSG? I know it's one of those fads to cut it, but you honestly might be allergic.

I've always had oddball allergies, because I have a form of eczema, and I react differently to foods that others are ok with.

As a kid it was chocolate, peanuts, tomatoes, and citric acid off the top of my head.

These days I've grown out of the chocolate and tomato allergies, and I don't react to peanuts unless I have a large quantity of them. Shellfish, ginger, (possibly) MSG, high amounts of Citric Acid and a few other oddities are the bane of my existence though. I can't even touch raw fish with bare skin -iodine allergy-, yet I can eat it cooked (but not **shell**fish).

Anyway, I know it's rough, some of us just react to our own sweat, so keeping a daily log of exercise might also be a key.

Do you use detergent? Fabric softener? Try the ""Free"" variety for a more hypoallergenic version. Certain types of makeup make me look like [this](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f5/Extra_flotation_devices.jpg) so don't rule anything out.",R

ampyxgiraffe,"Doing all this will help you overcome the scratching:

1. An hour before you go to sleep, take Hydroxyzine.  (once you're a little better this can be replaced with something less potent like Zyrtec)

2. Cover your hands in moisturizing cream, and then put on cara cotton gloves (Amazon sells them).  Then, put on Hand Control Mitts (Amazon also sells these).  The hand control mitts will physically prevent you from scratching.  Amazon has several variants including some that use Velcro to tighten, and some that use straps.  Any of the ones with good reviews should work.

3. For any location on your skin that you would typically scratch, make sure you cover that area with ample moisturizing cream as well, and then bandage with rolled gauze.  That way the cream won't get on your sheets, it will stay moisturized longer, and the gauze also adds an extra layer of protection from scratching.

4. In the middle of the night if some part of you feels itchy, then instead of scratching, you just apply more moisturizing cream to that area, and cover in gauze again.  The moisturizing cream should cause it to itch less.

5. Make sure your sleeping environment is comfortable.  Use a fan or AC if it gets hot sleeping with gauze wrap on.  Getting an air purifier could help too - those help filter out any potential allergens in the air that could be irritating your skin.",R

If your traditional doctor can do this (otherwise go to a naturopath and they should be able to do it) insist on a food sensitivity panel and a lot of allergy testing. Sometimes things don't come back as ""true allergies"" but really affect the system. It could be something as simple as a dye, or for me it is eggs, gluten and cane sugar.

aleczia,"I see a lot of comments here already, but I'm going to chime in anyway. This is gonna be a long one.

Three years ago, I was furiously googling how to solve this issue. For MONTHS. Even now, I still find myself googling about it, but mostly out of curiosity now instead of desperation. The skin around my mouth burned and itched and at its worse, it would weep a lot of yellow fluid. It was so out of nowhere, too. I used to be the kind of person that tried out different skin care brands without a worry, but now I couldn't even use my staples of many years anymore because they'd irritate my mouth.

Before I eventually caved and saw a doctor, I bought a bunch of eczema lotions, creams, etc. and slathered them over my mouth. I would just have a thick, white layer of cream over my mouth because it would give me a sort of relief. But it was always still there, yknow? I spent easily almost $1000 during this period. I tried literally everything I saw on the internet, Diaper rash cream, not using anything at all on my face, etc. Nothing helped. I was hoping to avoid the doctor, because I don't have insurance, but at that point, I've spent so much already and I'm so desperate for relief that I just went and saw a couple of doctors.

I saw a dermatologist, and she recommended that I just use CeraVe moisturizer and Vanicream face wash. She also gave me Elidel. The CeraVe stung, but not too bad I guess. The Elidel gave me relief. But, after two days, it didn't seem to be doing much anymore. My skin started to get bad again. I was really frustrated after tasting relief for the first time in two months, only for it to go away in two days. I kept using it anyway, to give it a chance. After about a week, I started getting dazed and confused while using it, and that was kinda alarming, so I stopped using it.

Two days later, my skin was progressively going bad again, but I was trying to hold out until I could see my dermatologist again in three days. I accidentally got water with detergent splash a bit on my face (literally, like, three droplets) while doing laundry, and my face got furious. It itched and burned and hurt so bad I was honestly ready to kill myself. I mean that seriously. I couldn't get relief. I would splash cold water on my face, which would feel a little good, but it would immediately feel bad again as my skin dries up. And the tears from my crying weren't helping either.

I shoved a bunch of melatonin in my mouth and hoped that it'd just make me go to sleep, but it doesn't work that way. It can't just knock me out like I was wishing it would. Eventually, I just grabbed the Elidel and slathered it on my face. At that point, I didn't even care if I get some sort of brain damage or whatever for using it.  I would have rubbed literal shit on my face if it meant I could get relief. I was that desperate. It calmed my skin down by a lot, and the melatonin I took earlier helped me fall asleep after three hours of crying and splashing water and slathering moisturizer on my face. The next day, I woke up with a trail of thick, dried, yellow fluid on my face. That was the worse the oozing got.

They gave me a really strong steroid cuz it looked really bad when I came into the dermatologist's office. Of course, that super strong steroid worked. But only while I used it. It wasn't safe to keep using it on the face for long term. After the two weeks I was told to use it, it came back with a vengeance not even two days later. So then another dermatologist gave me an antifungal+weaker steroid combo to use for two weeks. She also told me to stop using the CeraVe and just use Vanicream's lotion, and that my shampoo and conditioner should be from the Free &amp; Clear line, which is from the same company that makes Vanicream. And I needed to use a sensitive, basic detergent for my clothes, too, just in case.

After this, it was weeks more of going back and forth between doctors (I saw four dermatologists in total, from two offices) because nothing was fixing it. They gave me creams and pills and everything. Eventually, the dermatology office said that they can't do anything for me anymore. I was told that I should see an allergist.

So I did. The allergists' office cared a lot more about what I had to say, honestly. I spent an hour in the office just talking to the doctor and her assistant. I didn't feel rushed like I did with the dermatologists. They wrote down everything I use, asked about my home environment (like if I had any pets, if I had certain plants around my house, etc), all the details about what I'm feeling. But after seeing them for three weeks, even they got stumped. I took the test panels and everything, and the results didn't really help them in helping me. They told me that I will probably just have to maintain with steroids. I asked if there's an alternative for Elidel, because it's not a steroid and it helps, but I get bad side effects from it. They prescribed me Eucrisa.

I didn't really feel optimistic about it. At this point, it was probably five or six months since everything started. But I used it anyway, because, well, I still want relief. It stung bad every time I used it. I used it twice a day. But it helped so much. Within a few months, I was able to just use it once a day and feel normal. I wasn't afraid to go out anymore because I didn't have a thick layer of cream or ointment or whatever over my mouth. In fact, nowadays, I wear a ton of makeup, when this was unimaginable before my skin got managed by Eucrisa. I'm also at a point where I can skip a night of Eucrisa and feel mostly okay the next day. I never tried past two days, though, because I could already feel my skin itching a little after 36 hours.

I found that my skin would get worse after eating dairy, and that chemical SPFs and SLS were big no-nos for my skin. I also found that taking probiotics and allergy pills helped. I've been taking claritin for the last year and a half, but after seeing my allergist for a check up earlier this year, she suggested I try to use allegra. I read up about it and found out that it might work better for me cuz it's also for treating skin hives and itchiness, so now I'm just trying to finish through my claritin supply before switching over. Eucrisa is definitely doing the bulk of the work, though.

Here's my story. I hope you don't feel alone. I definitely understand how you feel, and I hope that relief finds its way to you, soon.

Here's a little list of things that I use/d specifically because of the mouth rash. I don't know if they'll bring the same results to you, though, so always be cautious.

* Eucrisa
* Vanicream face wash &amp; moisturizer
* Free &amp; Clear shampoo and conditioner (but I actually just use whatever SLS-free shampoo there is, nowadays)
* Plain vaseline (as lip balm)
* fluoride free strawberry children's toothpaste (allergist said to avoid mint. but I found that I can get away with mint sls-free toothpaste like sensodyne now so long as I make sure to rinse my mouth area well, so i dont use children's toothpaste anymore.)
* Tide Free &amp; Gentle (I now also use Downy Scent boosters, but only for clothes. using it on towels that I use to dry my face with irritates my face)
* SPF-free makeup (most makeup has chemical sunscreen. i found that my face is ok with physical sunscreen though)
* Claritin and probiotics. I also take fish oil and vit d but for other reasons, so I don't know if they have an effect on the rash.
* Dairy alternatives when I want to eat dairy.",R

anna_alabama,"yeah give them a call! 

Dupixent works by blocking a type of protein called an interleukin, or IL, from binding to their cell receptors. Interleukins contribute to a functioning immune system by helping to fight off viruses or bacteria in our bodies. When the immune system goes haywire, it can trigger certain ILs to mistakenly attack the body, resulting in chronic inflammatory conditions such as eczema.

Dupixent works on two interleukins thought to contribute to atopic diseases: IL-4 and IL-13. By blocking IL-4 and IL-13 from binding to the receptors, Dupixent curbs the immune system over-reaction that results in atopic dermatitis. A calmed immune system leads to fewer and/or less severe symptoms of AD.",R

Getmybaby,"I have Dishydrotic eczema, and some other eczema related skin issues on my scalp and on my left side. These have persisted with me for over 20 years. 

I have a new condition that has cropped up and I want to know if anyone else has this?

Six days ago I started getting nickel-sized bumps on the bottom of my feet that itch like mad. They swell up and are painful to walk on. I have tried Benadryl and betamethasone cream and they do literally nothing at all. My Dr. didn't want to give me prednisone for this due to Covid and how it can weaken the immune system.

These bumps feel just like mosquito bites. I can feel them coming on, it feels like a brief sharp pain followed by intense itching and very slight swelling. Whenever I get one there is one mirrored exactly on the opposite side of the other foot. If it's under the ball of my foot on my right foot, one will appear on the exact same spot on my left foot minutes later. 

I find that soaking my feet in hot water for a few minutes makes them stop itching and they will disappear within about 10 minutes.

Three days ago these started appearing on the palms of my hands too. Same routine. If it's below my thumb on my left hand, one will appear below my thumb on my right hand. They started as a once a day flare-up, but now they happen all day long.

iceranger309,"Hi, med student here with my 2 cents. If your scalp is feeling itchy with a lot of dandruff, you might have seborrheic dermatitis. It's a fungal infection that tends to grow in areas rich in sebaceous glands (hair) and irritates your scalp. Do you find it affects mostly around scalp and eyebrows but spares other areas of the face?

If so, common treatment is by using selenium sulfide shampoo (selsun) which has a 1% (blue) and 2.5% (gold) variant. I don't know of other brands, but selenium sulfide is what you need to look for on the bottom. Start with a week or so of continuous use to see if it works. If it does, know that you will need to reapply every now and then (a week or so every few weeks) to keep the effect. Also FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS. It needs to be left on your hair for a few minutes and it'll drip over your eyes and be a little annoying. If it doesn't give you as much relief as you'd like you can also use steroid creams to help control it. 

Seek medical advice if neither of these help because it might be something else and it's hard to know without seeing. Best of luck!",R

Pantone186,"I got a random bout of eczema at 30 after having nearly perfect (body) skin my whole life. It started on my arms and eventually spread to my back and face. It was pretty severe (I looked like a troll and had to be prescribed sleeping pills as the itchiness nearly drove me mad) and it took me a year to get rid of it but here's what helped. 

After being prescribed tons of hydrocortisone creams and not having much success, what finally worked was Protopic. Within a two weeks of application (2x a day) the rashes started to go away. With that said, once I stopped using Protopic the rashes started to come back so I knew it was a just a temporary solution. 

After months of doing my own research, I decided to tackle this b*** of a disease from every angle. Today, I am happy to say I am eczema free and have not had to reach for my tube of Protopic in months. My routine is below:

Body Wash: La Roche Posay Lipikar Cleaning Oil applied with a Japanese Salux Wash Cloth to slough off dead skin and facilitate cream penetration. 

Body Moisturizer: AmLactin Body Lotion (this has a whopping 12% lactic acid and changed the texture and feel of my skin. I will never be without it)

Face Care AM: La Roche Posay Effaclar (I have oily, acne-prone skin and the salicylic acid in this helps to clean pores on a deep level), The Ordinary Lactic Acid 10%, The Ordinary Niacinamide + Zinc and The Ordinary Azelaic Acid + Embriolisse as an under-eye moisturizer.

Face Care PM: La Roche Posay Effaclar, prescription tretinoin 0.025%, Embriolisse as an under-eye moisturizer

Vitamins (I really think this is what helped the most): Double dose of probiotics, omega 3/6, double dose of vitamin D, B12 and a magnesium pill before bed.

I hope this helps! Good luck everyone :)",R

I????€?m 30 and my hands look like those of an 80 yr old. I had a virtual drs appt this weekend and he prescribed my oral prednisone in addition to topical steroids to get it to clear up, but I know it will start up again afterward due to withdrawal which is what happened last time. I can????€?t seem to break this cycle and I????€?m so frustrated :/",R
SamL214,"**TL;DR:** got a bad break out that is no longer here, but hands are like I just came out of the bath for a week. Advise? Thanks!

So I get dyshidrotic eczema sometimes and this last time was pretty bad. My bother made dinner for the family about a month ago and used a ton of meat tenderizer on the meat for fajitas (although there was a lot of peppers [idk if other people have problems with nightshade plants too but anyway]). That dinner flared out my hands bad. Bumps everywhere. Then peeling then dry skin.

So after using steroid cream and cera ve(honestly a life saver and I don't actually ever have chronic problems until now) my hands are pretty much no longer broke out. One here or there. 

Yet, my hands dry out severely during the night. Looking like a just came out of the pool. No flaking or peeling. Still very smooth. And I use minimal lotion so my hands can increasingly get back to where they were before all this. I interchange gold bond wth cera ve. But I'm still having problems getting my hands to not look like I've spent hours in the jacuzzi. Has this happened to anyone? What's your solution? ",R
crypticandclueless,"In my experience, if it stings when your skin is very damaged but stops stinging after maybe 10 minutes or so instead of getting worse, you're good. If the product is helpful it will help your skin heal and it will eventually no longer sting when it's less damaged. 

Then again my skin got so damaged even just getting cold water on it burned incredibly, so like... if your product is stinging when your skin is not a weeping mess maybe try something else. Steroid creams also burn me when I let my eczema get out of hand, but it's probably because any protective layer my skin still had is gone by the time it's that bad. In general it's not good to use steroids continually, but also p. useless to just use one once and then stop immediately. What works best to calm a flare for somewhat longer is: 1 or two days with a stronger corticosteroid, then 2 days with a lighter one, another few days with yet a lighter one until it's really gone (+ 1 day of using a very light one when there's nothing visible, according to my derm). Then just keep moisturising and stop corticosteroids until something triggers a flare again.

What I do when I test a new product is: I put it on one half of my face and not on the other for a few days. Then I compare results. Sometimes products that initially stung get the skin to look better and products that seemed fine initially cause obvious irritation on one half of my face by day \~4 or so. It's really hard to know what's good for your skin with eczema sometimes tbh.",R

aqueoushumor,"FYI not a good idea to supplement too much iodine without seeing a doctor. Literally the only use of iodine in the body is for producing thyroid hormone. Too much can cause a goiter. You really don't need much and most people generally get enough iodine from eating products containing iodized salt. If you saw an improvement, you should have your thyroid levels checked, as hypothyroidism can cause dry skin. You could be experiencing a temporary boost that will fizzle out over time. Especially have you thyroid checked if you had any other symptoms such as fatigue, weight gain, ""brain fog"", etc. It's a simple blood test but you'd need to stop taking the iodine for about 6 weeks first.

Topical iodine may help when rashes become slightly infected, particularly with common staph, as the iodine kills the bacteria. This may help with secondary infections that slow up healing, or directly, as there is some speculation that some people with eczema may have an allergy to staph itself. But iodine can cause skin irritation, so keep an eye out for that. I'm not sure how iodine compares to a dilute bleach bath, but the latter is an often recommended treatment for infection-prone eczema.",R

slothcough,"I've been searching for a liquid foundation forever and haven't found one that I'm not allergic to- I have super sensitive skin on my face which goes hand in hand with flare-ups. BUT! Mineral foundations are great. First I do scotch-tape exfoliation (never anything stronger or else it will irritate the skin) to gently lift away any flakes. Then moisturize, then apply mineral foundation. If I don't exfoliate, the makeup will just emphasize any flakiness on my skin. I love CoverFX- it's not too expensive, and it was originally developed at a hospital for burn victims and other people with very sensitive skin.

If you're interested in hunting down some liquid foundation, I recommend going to a sephora. Just tell them you have super sensitive skin and they'll be happy to give you samples to take home and patch test.

odelie-,"Hi, r/eczema, first time poster here! I've been dealing with eczema on my arms and face for about a year now. 3 months ago, I cleared up entirely while I was using 0.05 hydrocortisone and decided to stop using it, but within a month I was miserable and finally decided to see a dermatologist. He put me on Betaderm 0.1 ointment for my body and Protopic 0.1 for my face. He wanted me to use it twice a day for a long time and that threw me off, so I managed to see another derm who suggested I try to phase out of the meds as much as possible. So now, about a month since I started using those two creams, I'm putting them only once every 48h and I'm doing quite good! I'm confident I might be able to phase out entirely, or at least go back to milder stuff.

Now, Betaderm has caused mild discoloration on my arms and I don't really mind, but I've noticed a bunch of moles appearing on the areas I use the cream. They're quite small and some are very pale but I've been getting little clusters of darker, freckle-like spots on my face and I'm not sure if it's normal? The spots are flat and very subtle, but I've never really had freckles and rarely take any sun, so it's a bit strange. Anyone has had similar things happen before?",R

So my eczema is at a nasty place right now where it seems to be in a permanent flare up. I tend to run hot which means I sweat a lot, so I only wear pants when I sleep at night.

However since this permanent flare up, going to bed is a nightmare. I slather on cream then moisturiser before bed, but since my eczema is on like 70% of my body I just feel all icky and like I'm sticking to my sheets.

Inevitably I itch the night away, and wake up in the morning with open wounds on my legs/bum, scratches on my back/sides, raw balls, and the rest of me just feeling on fire/tight.

(Warning for itchiness triggers)

Most of the time it feels like tiny bugs attacking my skin and ripping little holes into it.

Antibiotics short term answer obviously.

A few options

Immunosuppressants-(low dosage of methotrexate) works for my eczema, took about 4months to actually become effective. 
Possible dietary changes. 
Wet wraps twice a day.
There are some heavy tar based prescription products (safe, contains no steroids) like cocois which may be effective for your kneck.

There are lots of approaches to take with eczema, we all have different types, triggers, stories etc but I kinda see it as a journey where we have to go through a trial and error proccess, with the everlasting hope we will finally find something that works. For all the people on this with horror stories and incurable eczema there are far more who have found things that have worked for them and seen great improvement. Be optimistic, don't be hard on yourself, speak with your dermatologist, maybe look into any one of the options I mentioned above and I'm sure you will find a system that works, good luck.

Some Web sites about it are utter garbage though, topical steroid have their place, but too much can be bad and tsw is often diagnosed as more eczema and give more steroids making it worse. ",R

Gerby726,"The skin thinning will heal over time if you have discontinued over usage of steroids, my arms and hands were so thin it was like playing with play dough but they have gotten better.  And are like almost normal skin again. 

As for dupixent if you are in the usa, it is hell to get onto with insurance, id find a allergist/immunologist whos willing to go through all the medication you have to try before you can apply and hopefully get approved to get into the dupixent myway program and be able to have your insurance approve it. 

Until then try to find what causes your eczema cuz sometimes you can figure it out(dust, cats, dogs, milk, stress) and try to eliminate those things because even if it doesn???????€????t do shit to help right away it will help in the long run by putting less strain on your body. (Idk recently I cut out drinking milk and keep an eye on how much sugar I consume and flares have been maybe once a day instead of constantly) 

Im on dupixent so I don???????€????t know if this will help you since I???????€????ve since forgotten how my eczema acted before I went on it, but let it dry out, it is in my opinion more bareable to be dry and uncomfortable then inflamed and in pain. (Might be another reason for less flares) 

Dupixent unfortunately isn???????€????t a cure-all but better drugs similar to it are coming (delayed by the pandemic D; ) in the future and thats what keeps me going. (Ive become allergic to dupixent) like this really cool oral medication that takes the itching away or a drug like dupixent where you inject it but it doesn???????€????t have the eye problems that dupixent can cause (thats whats happening to me).

Idk how to help with the gf thing I luckily met my gf before my eczema went to hell(sometimes I think im allergic to her) but shes stuck around for the past 4 years of mine being absolute hell. Even if all my eyebrows fell out and my face skin sheds off weekly. So just keep searching or be optimistic there are people who look past how you are physically. 

I think I have gotten to the point in my own eczema journey(I also was born with it) where I have accepted it won???????€????t get better and all I can do is try to make it live-able. And it hurts accepting that but my doctor has said to me ???????€????I don???????€????t know how you can be so patient waiting for things to get better???????€???? and its because I don???????€????t think they will get better so it makes it easier on me when they actually do or don???????€????t, if I have no expectations so I can???????€????t get disappointed when something doesn???????€????t work. (Idk if that???????€????s healthy but thats just what I do) 

Keep your chin up, we all out here suffering separately but together. But once you turn that pure rage and hatred twords it into something else it really helps mentally, because this disorder is so mentally draining, but don???????€????t let it kick you while your down, fight back! I hope you can find what works and helps you cope with it!

I'm reasonably certain I didn't roll the placebo (the odds were in my favour this time at 75%) and I've noticed a significant decrease in overall and incidental itchiness, although I unfortunately still flare up occasionally, often linked to sweat and/or stress. This could however be attributed to an environmental shift (I'm less prone to outdoor/seasonal allergies in the winter), and one downside is that there hasn't been an obvious improvement on my skin actually being dry and flaky. I'm sure that scratching less has helped indirectly though.

I will tell you that mine was always extremely manageable until a few months ago, when twice it blew up like you wouldn't believe and changed my life. It was absolutely horrifying. You're either ingesting something or coming into contact with something that is very bad for your body. The skin and liver are where the toxins are released from your body, so your skin is screaming at you that there's a problem. It's a warning to you to do something now. I successfully cleared up a chronic case. It became manageable within about a week, and now a month later is almost completely gone.

nova1979,"My stepdaughter (18 years old) was recently approved to start this drug (she starts in the next week or 2). The first question the dermatologist asked me is whether I had insurance. Right there I knew that this was gonna be an expensive drug. Thankfully I have a great plan through my employer. When they phoned me to give me the breakdown, I almost fainted. I was told that my insurance covers 80% which was fantastic. However that left me with approximately $540/box out of my own pocket (and my daughter will require 14 boxes in the first year). I was informed that my insurance had a cap of $3000. In other words, after purchasing my 6th box, I'd be covered 100% for the rest of the calendar year. Still not ideal for me. Being a one income family, I wasn't sure I could even afford that. Thankfully I was eligible for the co-pay plan which covered 90% of the remaining 20% so the out of pocket expense for me turns out to be +/- $54/box which is awesome. I've read nothing but good things about this drug so my fingers are crossed it works out for her as her quality of life is really suffering at this point. Not gonna lie; when taking a new med, I always worry about the long term side effects (i.e. them discovering years down the road that this drug caused &lt;insert ailment&gt; in people that took it).

I just can't believe that some people are actually stuck paying the entire cost of the drug which is upwards of $37,000/year; I don't even know how one can afford that... I am so thankful I have the means to get this medication for my stepdaughter at an affordable cost. As a third party witness to her (I don't have any form of eczema myself), I feel for all those who suffer with this; my stepdaughter describes the feeling is akin to having bugs constantly crawling on her skin. I couldn't even fathom what that must feel like.

One of the biggest problems in my eczema was always the lips and around, always dry so I always used lipsticks to relieve, people called me girl so I started to do it without anyone seeing. 2 years later my eczema peaked, I went into depression and didn't leave the house all day and in the summer and on vacation I never went to the beach or swimming pools ashamed of the famous phrases: ""Are you fine? You're bleeding"". My mother took me to a doctor who improved my eczema, my arms and legs improved, but the psychological damage will never be cured. Until recently I was unable to wear a t-shirt at school but luckily I managed to overcome that, because my biggest problem with eczema is what people will think of me and that makes socialization very difficult. Nowadays I have not so severe eczema, I take medication I apply creams and ointments, the places that bother me the most are the right hand that is constantly injured and the face that one day is good and the other day is not, this is the worst feeling of having eczema is not knowing how we are going to wake up the next day.

coffeegal716,"
Alright, let me start by saying that this subreddit had been giving me LIFE. This condition is a mental battle and isolating, even when the people in your life are understanding. I have been in this thread almost daily whether it is to cheer y???????€????all on or find something new to try! 

Now to the good stuff. I have always been an eczema sufferer. It was the usual arm and leg cracks that were only seasonal. After I graduate college (around 22) EVERYTHING CHANGED. I had eczema all over my body. Face, arms and legs. I kept myself awake at night clawing all over and getting blood on everything I owned. 

I live in Philly so here we have the University of Pennsylvania Medical system that takes virtually any insurance you can imagine. It???????€????s awesome because top medical experts are down the block. So I made a derm appointment at Penn Dermatology. 

Skipping through some in between stuff, I mostly got my eczema under control. It???????€????s not clear, but through aggressive moisturizing and using just a touch of steroid cream when it flared, I???????€????ve been doing relatively better than last year. 

Fast forward to now, it???????€????s been about 2 months of this awful periorial dermatitis on my face. It hurts so much and has really slashed my confidence. I made another derm appointment but the earliest one was in 2 months so I scoured this subreddit to make a list of things to talk to my doctor about, like dupixent. I noticed a lot of folks talking about protopic so I added that to my list. 

Now, on Wednesday this week, I???????€????m on the subreddit again at work and I have a flash back and remembered my derm prescribed me this one CRAZY EXPENSIVE CREAM that I did not even continue to use. I got home, found that $200 tube and googled it. turns out, IVE HAD PROTOPIC THIS WHOLE TIME, just the generic name!!!! So the reason I didn???????€????t use it the first time around is because it made my skin burn like FIRE. like someone had literally poured gasoline on me and dropped a match. I thought I was having a reaction to it so I put it away and never used it again. 

So it???????€????s still 1.5 months away from my appointment and I am DESPERATE to clear this up, so I try it again. I took a shower Wednesday night and put it on right after. There was some mild tingling but I was fine. THEN, it starts to burn like someone peeled away my skin and now I???????€????m eating the world hottest chicken wings. I became incredibly irritated and grabbed everything in my freezer to numb the pain. I took some Benadryl but barely slept that night. I thought I was never going to stop suffering. 

I wake up the next morning and my skin is tight, less red, and noticeably less bumpy. At least the pain wasn???????€????t for nothing! I make the brave the decision to put it on again the following night, this time right before bed. No burning, just a little tingling. 

Fast forward to this morning. That???????€????s me on the right! If you have protopic, and can manage pushing through the painful side effects, it???????€????s worth the results. If you don???????€????t have protopic, ask your derm about it. 


???????€???????????€????

I was ashamed that anyone would be seen with me. I finally bit the bullet and went to my doctor after I figured it wasn???????€????t dryness or acne or bad skincare. I got prescribed prednisone and it was a godsend. It came back after the treatment ,though not as bad. A little on the eye. A little spot here and there. Some spots on my body.

pastaenthusiast,"I know how you feel. Having eczema can be incredibly awful- it can really hurt your emotional and physical health. We have been there as well. It was especially frustrating when I was about 20 because people had kept telling me that I would grow out of it, and I had to accept that I was not going to grow out of it. That sucked.

HOWEVER, despite years (my whole life) of trying all sorts of steroids, antibiotics, lotions, creams, and pretty much everything under the sun, I found a dermatologist that actually helped. My GP and walk in doctors would just throw some steroid cream at it and downplay its severity, but this derm said ""woah, this is not acceptable. Your skin is AWFUL"". It was such a relief to be taken seriously. 

Since then, with a lot of professional help, my skin vastly improved. What I'm saying is keep trying. Find a dermatologist. If that doesn't work out after 6 months or so try a different one. There are a LOT of options here. Your skin will probably never be perfect and you'll always have to work at it, but you can probably get it to a level that allows you to focus on things that aren't your skin.

You HAVE to deal with your emotional health. People don't like talking about it, but depression and anxiety can affect your skin in real, physical ways. Eczema sucks, but having eczema does not mean that you can't have a love life and if you're 'constantly miserable' you have a bigger problem than your eczema. Get help. It's hard to tell if you're suicidal in your post but it's worrying. Your skin can make you feel awful, but you need to find ways of living your life and you can do that with help. Seriously. 

If you are a self proclaimed 'natural defeatist' you could probably use some help coming up with better coping strategies. I was 'defeatist' about my eczema for years- I didn't bother seeking out other dermatologists because I'd had bad experiences in the past and felt like there was nothing else they could offer me. I was wrong. Eczema treatments are ever changing, but for you to be able to take advantage of these developments you have to seek help. 

Good luck. I really hope that you find something that works for you!

PS one final note. You haven't mentioned purging your environment, but figuring out what you're allergic to and reducing your exposure to it is really important. If you haven't already had allergy testing, that can be really helpful. If you can't access that, try removing common allergens (such as using unscented laundry soap, reducing exposure to cat/dog dander, not using scented products, changing your shampoo to something sulfate free etc.)",R
Grilled_Chz_Plz,"I have extreme eczema on my hands and wrists (most of the time my hands are bandaged). I????€?ve tried EVERYTHING. BUT, I????€?ve been dry brushing for about a month and it????€?s 80% GONE and I haven????€?t bandaged my hands for a couple weeks! 

For those who don????€?t know what Dry Brushing is: you use a NATURAL bristle brush that is about the size of your hand (you can find them at natural food stores), mine has a long handle on it to make it easier to get your back. Synthetic bristles are too harsh for skin. Right before you shower gently brush your skin, starting at your feet, always single strokes towards your heart. From what I understand, this helps the circulation of your lymphatic system to help rid of toxins. I recommend researching to get a more detailed explanation and instruction. DEFINITELY drink lots of water after dry brushing to help flush toxins OUT of your body before they settle somewhere else. Cucumber &amp; lemon juice is an added help in removing toxins.

I had only dry brushed for about a week when I started noticing a difference. I avoided brushing my painful patches for a while until my wounds were healed enough to brush them a bit. I would definitely recommend trying this out! ",R

KitBar,"Hi guys,

&amp;#x200B;

I just wanted to let you know, if you live in Canada, the CADTH has opened up patient input regarding it's recommendation on reimbursing Dupixent for public health care drug formularies. It initially recommended against reimbursement, but according to the nurse I spoke to, they are revisiting their previous recommendation.

&amp;#x200B;

 [https://cadth.ca/about-cadth/what-we-do/products-services/cdr/patient-input/open-calls-for-patient-input](https://cadth.ca/about-cadth/what-we-do/products-services/cdr/patient-input/open-calls-for-patient-input) 

&amp;#x200B;

If you would like to input your experience with the drug or atopic dermatitis, please read this to fill out the template.

 [https://cadth.ca/about-cadth/what-we-do/products-services/cdr/patient-input](https://cadth.ca/about-cadth/what-we-do/products-services/cdr/patient-input) 

&amp;#x200B;

I am currently on employer health benefits which allows me to access Dupixent. For me, it has been life altering. I am sure many of you live with this disease (duh, your on here) so this could be life altering for many of you as well; I don't think I need to explain why having CADTH recommend this drug for reimbursement is important for us Canadians. This could mean that everyone in Canada can get access to Dupixent without employer health benefits. This will also allow for future drugs to be approved for the public to access new drugs for this disease.

&amp;#x200B;

if you are Canadian and have used Dupixent, please help get Dupixent on the recommended drug reimbursement list. There are no other options and for most of us currently on this drug, it requires employer benefits to live normal lives.",R

WikiTextBot,"**Dyshidrosis**

Dyshidrosis, is a type of dermatitis, that is characterized by itchy blisters on the palms of the hands and bottoms of the feet. Blisters are generally one to two millimeters in size and heal over three weeks. However, they often recur. Redness is not usually present.

halie91,"you can be tested for dust mite allergy (as a blood test for example).

But you can also just try eliminating them as much as possible and seeing if you improve.  It will probably take many weeks for you to notice changes however.

Here are some things that help:

 * hire cleaners if you can afford it (it's a catch 22 since by cleaning you can also irritate your skin, especially when the skin barrier is already composed...)
 * wash sheets with HOT water (only way to kill dust mites)
 * change your sheets regularly, especially your pillow case (I would change them every 3 days when I was bad and pillow case every day)
 * vacuum your mattress when you change your sheets
 * buy BREATHABLE (very important, you have to feel comfortable) pillow case cover.  It sounds gimmicky but I tried a bunch and the Claritin brand was the most comfortable for me.  I didn't end up buying the mattress cover so can't speak to it but maybe consider that too.
 * do not put cream on right before bed nor shower right before bed.  Give your skin at least a couple of hours to absorb that stuff.
 * keep a duster handy and dust often
 * if you run a ceiling fan make sure it's super clean
 * use an air purifier in your bedroom
 * use an allergy-rated air filter in your hvac
 * more extreme: get rid of carpet, get hardwood floors.  Get rid of non-leather sofas and chairs.",R
Yaypeasants,"hi guys!

just wanted to share with you guys how eliminating nightshades from my diet has helped me. Before I found out about this diet, I literally lived on nightshades. I loved eating tomatoes and bell peppers because of how easy it is to cook. my favourite soup had tomatoes *and* potatoes in it, so it was incredibly hard for me to start this diet at first. it does get easier though, I've been on this diet for a little more than a month now, and I've got to say that it's been helping! 

I still get flare ups from time to time because I'm really allergic to dust mites and my accommodation has carpeted floors, so it's basically impossible to keep the dust out of my room. plus I also smoke (tobacco belongs in the nightshade family too unfortunately, haha) so I think that's kinda been keeping me back a little. I also have the occasional mcdonalds meal so I end up eating fries hehe 

but yea! I've also included pictures of before and after the diet which you can see [here](https://imgur.com/a/ZGjLv). The before picture was taken at literally the worst time of my life, it hurt to even move my arm, and the eczema started to spread to my face; I was really depressed and anxious about it because you know, eczema's just not a very good look.

Im now taking vitamin d and cod liver oil capsules daily (I saw that people with eczema are lacking in vitamin d more so than others AND what I think has made the most difference is the omega 3 (cod liver oil capsules) I saw a women post on here that her daughters eczema flares really bad when she doesn???????€????t take them so I became very interested and researched and saw that omega 3 calms inflammation down in the body, when I started taking them the swelling started to get less every morning. 

What helped my eyelid dryness pretty much in one night was Aveeno moisturising cream WITH Eucerin Aquaphor on top I feel like these to together probably helped heal my skin barrier (this whole thing started as just small dry patches which I didn???????€????t bother to moisturise I guess the skin barrier became compromised and something got in?) I did as needed throughout the day and now I don???????€????t even need to use the aquaphor I just make sure the area is well moisturised.

Fast-forward to today, I'm in my early-30s and this rash developed on the backs of my thighs (literally my butt cheek/thigh divider, real cool place to scratch incessantly BTW!). After months of dealing with this rash, I went to the Doctor and was given an anti-fungal, I thought I noticed improvement... but it returned with a vengeance! Went back to the Doctor, mentioned the childhood eczema, he agreed it was eczema. I didn't want to plant that seed in his head, but I did, and that was my diagnosis.

Sooo I'm kind of new to this eczema business. I notice when I wear tight workout clothing it worsens, and when I use Aquaphor it worsens... what's working for you right now?",R
Search4Delicious,"&gt;How do you force yourself to go to uni when you wakeup and feel absolute shit

Oh it's been a struggle. Something I end up saying to myself a lot is to just ""swallow my pride"". Keeping things in perspective helps. Relative to other conditions, having a red face all the time isn't that much of a burden. No one takes it as seriously as you yourself take it, and generally people are pretty polite about it. But it's hard. I'm super self-conscious, anxious, and my confidence with girls and dating has been obliterated. But you only get one chance to be alive and you have to make the best of it. That's really the thing that helps me most from becoming a sad shut in.  

Anyway, the immunosuppressant route worked for you? You seem to basically be advocating for it. What's your experience been like with it?",R
Ocelot8096,"I just wanted to share this to show it's important to know about literally anything and everything that is touching your skin. I'd also recommend HIGHLY to see an allergist if you have not already. It has helped me immensely in figuring out that I DO have allergies to certain things, and then how to manage those.

I was in my mid to late 20s when I finally went and saw one AGAINST my derms recommendation (she said she only recommends it if you're a kid...but if you've never been to one in your life..?? Why not?). My skin was the worst it had ever been until I saw my allergist. Now it's the BEST it's ever been.

Anyway, to the story...

I posted on here about a month ago about tips for Dyshidrosis in the webs of my fingers. I don't typically get that type of eczema very often, even though it's winter now, so I thought it was strange. 

I've been trying the curly girl method for my hair and have been trying different products. I purchased VO5 shampoo and had been using it for over a month or so. I always check the ingredients, but somehow missed that all of these shampoos have the dreaded Methylchloroisothiazolinone. I immediately stopped using these and my hands were much improved by just one day of not using that shampoo. 

Hopefully this helps some of you in some way.",R

Liirin,"For the superdry airplane ride:

* I take all my full-size bottles of lotion/tubs of cream/Aquaphor in a check-in suitcase. 
* I make a travel-size bottle of my cleanser and two or three of my most moisturizing lotions/creams. Four if it's going to be more than 4 hours or so. I'm a big fan of oils, so I make an oil bottle, too. I also take a travel-size tube of Aquaphor.
* Take an EMPTY water bottle in your carryon. If you're not extremely picky about your water, you can just take the empty bottle in through security and fill it up at the water fountains around the airport. Since you'll need a lot of water to stay hydrated, it's a HUGE money saver!
* Make sure you drink as much water as you can physically handle. Drain and refill that sucker before boarding as many times as you can. Try to limit diuretics, like coffee and alcohol.
* Before we board, I cleanse my face in the bathroom, pat some more water on there, and put a whole bunch of moisturizer on. Then I slather my eye area and lips with the Aquaphor. Then I take a squirt of oil (maybe like 6-7 drops?) and pat that all around the rest of my face.
* If you don't want to do all that, you can just upend your water bottle on your hand a few times, and use that water. Then use a moisturizer and Aquaphor and/or oil.
* If the plane ride is less than 4 hrs, I'll just reapply the Aquaphor to my eye area and lips, and maybe more moisturizer for my hands and neck. Halfway through, I'll take some water from my water bottle, pat that in there, moisturize again, and oil again.
* I don't care where I'm going, I wear long sleeves and long pants every plane ride. It helps with the nasty itchiness of the seats, shields you from everyone's freaking air streams (the WORST), and if you want to take a nap, you have protection from their polyester blankets. It also keeps in a little more moisture than just your skin alone. Also, it's less surface area that I have to worry about visible flaking. 
* If you're tall, getting an extended foot space is a MUST. Eczema breakouts can be triggered by stress, and you really don't want to start getting upset about being smashed in. On my airline, it's like 30 bucks to upgrade the night before.
* If you're stuck next to a baby, or wedged in front of and behind two toddlers, ask the flight attendant if there are any other open seats. Check out the neighbors before moving, but it might seriously cause you less stress.

For the trip itself:

* I try to take more allergy medicine than I think I'll need. Allergies are a huge contributor to my eczema, so I'll take like a whole bottle of Zyrtec and a box of Benadryl tablets. I take twice the dose of the Zyrtec (and I ONLY do that because when it was prescription-only, that was my dosage and it worked out well for me), and then a tablet of Benadryl when I start feeling the itch. Many people like the Non-Drowsy, but hey. When I'm itchy, the drowsiness actually HELPS ME STOP. It's also fairly temporary.
* Make sure you take aloe vera with you (I always take a full bottle) in case you get any sun. Like, any sun at all. As soon as I get back to the room, I religiously reapply it every time it dries. You'll want to get a kind that doesn't have lidocaine in it (usually the ones with lidocaine are tinted blue, but check the active ingredients) so that you can reapply so often without painkiller overdose. If you want, take a travel-size lidocaine with you. The lidocaine aloe vera is really nice as a topical analgesic for unbearable itchiness, too. Look at the labels before you buy: You want the Alcohol or Isopropyl Alcohol to be as far down on the list as possible. Cetyl and Stearoyl are ok (they're moisturizing instead of drying), unless you know you're sensitive to that ingredient.
* DON'T CHANGE ANYTHING ABOUT HOW YOU DO YOUR SKINCARE. I absolutely cannot stress that enough. Eczematic skin hates everything, including change. Try not to change anything about your morning and nighttime skincare, because the climate and pollen will have changed enough that your skin will hate it. Don't be surprised if you have a flareup.
* If you see your General Practitioner anytime before the vacation, let them know that you're going on vacation and if your skin usually flares up on vacations. That way, if you really get in a tough spot, you can call their office and have them call in a local prescription for you. I usually have to do a short course of steroids when I'm visiting my grandmother in Florida, for example.
* Make sure you use sunscreen every day that you're outside. Use a physical sunscreen, with the active ingredients being zinc oxide and/or titanium dioxide. Try to find a formulation without fragrance, or made for babies. These are the least irritating sunscreens, even though they're the ones that leave a white cast. If the whiteness really bothers you, put foundation over it. I personally like it because I can manipulate it so that my red spots look more even, haha.
* Sunscreens are much more important than usual on vacations, because using extra product (including Vaseline/Aquaphor/oils) will make you a little more photosensitive. The oil that moisturizes will also attract the rays. It's really, really important to put sunscreen on after those ingredients.
* Try not to get sunscreens with oxybenzone and avabenzone as the active ingredients -- these tend to be more irritating, and I can feel it every time I use them.
* Make sure you bathe properly every night. You don't want to leave the sunscreen on your skin while you sleep, or under any ointments. Colloidal oatmeal is a great option for flaring skin that still needs cleansing. An extra cleanser afterwards would be ideal, especially for your face. Again, only use what works for you.
* Sheets: I literally always have a problem with these. I find out what size bed I'll have and just bring my own from home. Even requesting cotton is a problem, because hotels and such use the cheaper laundry detergents. A lot of those have so much fragrance that they're known to cause eczema. Many don't even HAVE all-cotton sheets. If you use a mite/allergen mattress cover, and the mattress that you will be sleeping on is the same size, BRING THAT, TOO. Your skin will thank you.

In the end, I always have a small flareup, regardless of all other factors. My skin absolutely hates change, and once I've found something that works for me, I will use it religiously. Traveling really messes all that up, so I always have some problems. If I have any leftover steroid ointment, I'll take that with me to spot-treat.",R
M-------,"&gt; my skin is rubbish at staying hydrated

So is mine.  Winter sucks, especially when we get a cold spell and there's zero moisture in the air.

I've had eczema all my life.  The one thing that has done the most to treat my eczema was never suggested to me by any doctor: antifungal cream.  I found it by random luck (trying stuff I found in the cupboard).  

I still have dry skin, but the discoloured/flaky/itchy/burning/cracking/bleeding patches on my face, neck, arms, trunk, and legs are gone, and have been for the better part of two years.  

If you haven't tried antifungals, consider it.  I used over-the-counter Canesten cream (clotrimazole), and mixed it with steroid cream.  Apply twice a day to one problem area, for one week straight, then discontinue use and see what happens.  

Obviously this won't work for everybody, but it worked so well for me.  Now my skin is merely dry, not itching/flaking/burning/etc.

coffeacoffea,"This depends on the type of eczema.. if it's atopic dermatitis, it's likely due to mutations in the filaggrin gene. But you can have mutations in your gene and be just fine. There are probably many other genes that causes eczema, we just don't know all of them.

We inherit a copy of the filaggrin gene from each parent and if we get two bad copies the worse the symptoms of eczema. But, it also depends on the specific gene you have, some filaggrin gene apparently makes 10 filaggrin proteins while others make 11 or 12. The more you make the better.

I used to think I inherited my atopic dermatitis (although no one else in my family has it), but then my derm told me that 50% of these mutations are spontaneous and not inherited! 

So, I've resigned to the fact that until we get to a point in medicine with routine gene sequencing.. It's sort of a crap shoot.

fuurin,"I had something similar when I was a teenager! I had blepharitis + probably also eczema because there were times when the skin was flaky on top of the terrible inflammation. 

&amp;#x200B;

  

I recommend TCM to anyone with eye area eczema / blepharitis / etc. because it was the only thing which worked for me.

I had blepharitis which has a lot of similarities with eczema on eyelids when I was a teenager, and only 3 months of drinking traditional Chinese  meds (herbs prescribed by a TCM practioner, boiled in a pot of water) +  applying warm compress (small towel soaked in the meds) made it go  away. I haven't had a relapse since, just the occasional itchy eye /  that eyelid bump thing a couple times a year which go away in a few days  after I use eyewash and eye drops. Drinking the (very bitter) meds also  helped my hand/arm/back-of-the-knee eczema go away at that time.

The  clinic doctors gave me terramycin and erythromycin and whatnot and they  were all terrible. None of them had effects lasting for longer than a  day, many of the ointments actually made things worse. Even the  pigmentation went away, so now I just have dark eye circles because of  my terrible sleep schedule lol. Honestly, TCM treatment from someone who  knows what they're doing can help so much.

If you know of a ***good***  TCM practitioner it's worth a shot, for the long term. And the good thing is that you can usually use TCM in conjunction with Western medicine without the two interfering.

Btw using eyewash might also help your eye area feel+get better, unless  your skin hates witch hazel or something. Cleaner eye area = better  recovery. I use Optrex as it doesn't irritate my eyes at all, some of  the other brands had a stinging/burning sensation which was deeply  unpleasant. If you buy Optrex, I would advise you to buy the small  bottle if you're not using it multiple times per day, or else you'll  find yourself having a lot of leftover one month later and having to  throw it out because eye products can't be kept for long once opened.  Another thing I also did was to put a small amount of eyewash on a soft  cotton pad and gently wipe my eye area when it feels uncomfortable. You  could also buy eyelid wipes, I've tried a brand called Systane but I  didn't like it as much as the eyewash on cotton pad method, but they're  very convenient if you're outside. The Systane wipes also smelled like almond milk for some incomprehensible reason.",R

I like to use the Too Faced Hangover primer all over my face, and then go in with the HYDRATING Porefessional by Benefit. the porefessional is really great at smoothing texture, and the hyaluronic acid in it pulls moisture throughout the day. a little goes a long way. finally, i use a thick cream (my friend gave me a VaniCream sample and that has been so amazing) and place it on the areas of my face that flake up. I know this is a lot of prep, but i work 8+ hour shifts, and without this routine i???????€????m a flakey mess by the end of it. I can say without a doubt that this routine has helped me so much.

after the prep, do your makeup as normal, but I do have a few tips to reduce irritation. First, do your base makeup with a clean sponge instead of brushes. this is a lot gentler on damaged skin. it prevents micro tearing and the spread of bacteria. Second, don???????€????t be afraid to set your face, just do so LIGHTLY. Do not bake, gently press in any powder products. Third, be gentle with brushes around the eye, for obvious reasons.

I firmly believe that everyone deserves to be comfortable in their makeup. you deserve to feel beautiful. i know it can be really hard sometimes. i get stuck in the trap of comparing myself to others every day. it???????€????s not worth it. you???????€????re a baddie, even on the bad days!!!! good luck!",R

EisGeist,"Hi!
My baby was the same way, and she is now six and despite all of the doctors telling me she would outgrow it, it rages on. Her symptoms are stress and heat related, with also a mild grass allergy that makes it worse on occasion. 

First thing I would do in your case is get some scratch sleeves with silk mitts for when the child is asleep, so they don't go at it at night and make everything worse. I ordered mine online.

Get into a routine of giving baths with oatmeal or Epsom salts. Try both to figure out what you prefer.

Get stocked on several high quality lotions for daily use. We use cetaphil Restoraderm twice a day all over her body, plus a tub of thick Eucerin for trouble spots throughout the day. I would read these subs for other recommendations - it's different for everyone and there are lots of brands to try.

For really bad flare ups I use protopic or a mild steroid, right when I see spots starting to come out. If I get it before it's full blown I only have to use the big guns for a couple of days and then I just go back to the regular routine. I hate using them at all, but sometimes it's the only way to get it to stop, and with kids they don't know how to handle it without scratching like crazy. I don't know, as long as you use with precaution (5 days on, 5 days off, only at night with protopic to avoid sunlight exposure) it's ok.

Lastly, get an appointment with a dermatologist who specialized in Eczema. My pediatrician (a lovely woman) put us through hell with elimination diets and buying new all of this special organic food and clothing, and within two minutes of seeing the specialist he said, ""yeah, that only works in a very small amount of people. Most likely for you it's genetic (yes!) and related to heat and stress"" (yes!) 

I could be different for you, but before going through all the effort of eliminating gluten or sugars, try to figure out your kid's triggers.

Good luck! Some kids really do outgrow it, but even if they don't there are a lot of great products out there to make it bearable, the hard part is sifting through it all to figure out the right combination for your kid. ",R

teapotshenanigans,"I have always had dry skin in winter but since having a baby in December, I've been going through hell with eczema on my hands/forearms (I've never had eczema before).  I have two young kids and I can't not deal with them.  Picking them up hurts.  Holding the baby hurts.  The baby wants to grab my hands and fingers and play with them.  My skin on the back of my hands and up my fingers ooze and it's disgusting.

My Dr. prescribed me Liderm ointment and it worked....  until I stopped using it.  Twice now my skin has reflared after stopping the use of the steroids so I don't want to use it anymore, I have no idea what it's doing to my breastmilk.

I can't do housework (though I finally found latex-free disposable gloves in town about a week ago) and I have had to switch laundry detergents and hand soap to try and find things that don't bother me.  I recently started using Glaxal Base as moisturizer as it was very clear the coconut oil I had been using just was not cutting it.  I also have gluten sensitivity so I avoid Aveeno products.

On top of all this I'm struggling with OCD and postpartum depression so I'm constantly paranoid I have staph, and that my kids are going to get sick because of me.  I'm having a fucking awful time and I can't help but think if I didn't have the skin problem my emotional state would be better...  I fucking cry every morning when I wake up and my skin isn't better...  Like as if magically I'll wake up one day and I can move my hands to pick up the baby and put him to my breast without it feeling like my skin is on fire.

I just had to rant guys I know some of you have lived with this your entire lives and I couldn't imagine how shitty that is.  I want to just rip my fucking skin off some days.  I hate myself for saying to my 3yo ""no, sorry honey mommy can't play that game it hurts my skin.""  Or sometimes I dread when the baby wakes up and needs me to hold him, feed him etc.  My hands and arms just hurt so much.

I do have a dermatologist appt at the end of the month though...  I really hope they can help.  I want to garden and go camping and I'm too scared.  I barely leave the house and when I do, I dread washing my hands if I have to because most people have scented soap and it kills my skin.

I'm sending my husband to the health food store to see if they have bentonite clay, I was reading yesterday that it can help eczema.  Can anyone verify this?

BadYoungBrother,"Sounds very much like classic symptoms of pompholyx/dyshidrosis. Mine used to break out worst on my hands before I saw a dermatologist who prescribed me dermovate. I can usually catch it before the blisters appear (if it becomes a recurrent you will get to know the telltale signs) but once they're on my hands the only thing I can do is leave the blisters and wait for the next phase which is very dry cracked hands and treat it with constant moisturizer (make sure it has no fragrance, Aveeno Skin Relief is the best I've found). I'd speak to your doctor on the phone if you can't get an appointment, see if you can get something like dermovate, they may be wary of giving you something so strong without a face to face examination but for me even betnovate wasn't strong enough to stop it. I'd be very reluctant to recommend something as drastic as prednisone if you are about to go on holiday and I'd be extremely surprised if any doctor would prescribe it without trying the stronger topical steroids first.
You may also notice the blisters appearing on the bottom of your feet but if that happens don't worry that's normal for pompholyx, the hands and the soles of your feet (and sometimes around the side) are where it breaks out. ",R

Although my full body flare ups are now more periodic (due to finding out my trigger through a full ISAAC blood test (servere sensitisations to mould)) it still crushes me when I think of it, and the anxiety can be overwhelming. I think the thing to remember is that what we are experiencing is relatively new- in the past it's likely that kids with auto immune conditions wouldn't always have made it to adult hood anyway, and that eczema was less common in general too. So I think we are pioneers in finding solutions really. Your condition won't be untreatable, it's just that the unique combination of triggers and causes for you, are not yet discovered. The shots you mentioned have incredibly high success rates, so there is real hope that that will be the answer for many people.

khittykhattt,"Initially, I did always feel bad calling in at work. I????€?m a nurse on a busy hospital unit. I would come in to work where the flare up just started. I start the work day with red and itchy rashes on my hands, neck and creases. By the end of the shift, the rash is all over my face, trunk, and legs. To make it worse, my rash on my face would bleed. After shifts like that, my director would make me go to Employee Health right away. I did this for at least 5 shifts till I realized that I can????€?t go to work even if I feel bad for missing out.

Okay so around January my lips began getting super dry and disgusting and it was awful. I????€?ve never had anything this bad, only in like middle school. I put hydrocortisone cream and it helped and I stopped using lip products except for aquaphor healing ointment. Here are some pics to show how it looked at it????€?s worst:

Right now there????€?s like this kind of dark line across my lips and the top lip was swollen. Also sometimes the inner lip gets really red. Here are some pictures:

I went to the doctor and she told me it was contact dermatitis and she prescribed me hydrocortisone like a steroid cream. I have it on my eyelids also btw. I was using it and it helped calm it down at first, but it just kept coming back. Eventually, I stopped because I felt like it was thinning my skin out and my skin got darker and like more sensitive I feel...like my dark circles got super bad. There????€?s like this line under my eye I never really had before or as prominent. My right eye is where it is mostly.

Mind you, this was kind of all of a sudden as I????€?ve never really had too many problems with my lips before except a few times they????€?ve randomly gotten swollen but nothing this bad and lengthy.

Nerissa_x,"Ask your doctor about Comfifast or ask for a referral to Dermatology if s/he is reluctant to prescribe; it's like clothing made of bandages so you can use it for wet-wrapping, or use Ichthopaste bandages underneath, or emollient creams, or just general moisturiser! Then wear your ordinary clothes over the top; they don't add much (if anything) in the way of warmth but I find them really good for putting a thick layer of emollient on before bed.

I stick around because i imagine that managing my eczema is going to be a lifelong commitment and this place is a great resource for information. I also want to offer support to people who need it because eczema is hell and irl support (from people who Get It) can be hard to find.  

A lot of people seem very, very anti alternative medicine. That's cool and i support people making whatever choice they think is going to be best for their skin. Naturopathy was the best choice for me. If steroids and immunosuppressants feel like the best choice for you then go for it. However, the vitriol directed at anything that isn't conventional does concern me. I worry about people rejecting something that might help them just because it seems too ""Chinese witch doctor yoga kombucha TSW"". And on that note, i wouldn't recommend anyone with severe eczema drink kombucha as it's high in histamine. Just take a quality probiotic.

OrangeHighlighter229,"Long post ahead. It's been a very tough time for me personally, emotionally, mentally. The harsh changes in the Bay Area weather has not helped. Basically my skin, especially my face, has taken a beating to all of it. Quick backstory: I am 1st generation Chinese-American, and don't have the best relationship with my mom. It's a communication thing. Cultural thing. She's my mom, I love her. But that's it. She's seen and dealt with my eczema since I was a baby. Naturally, I always assumed she understood my condition and what all of this was at least from Chinese doctors who could better explain it than I could. 

Fast forward to an hour ago. She saw me kind of scratching at my arms. Asked me why I don't do the allergy tests or do blood tests to see what's wrong with me. I told her I don't need to, I know what's wrong with me -- it is what it is. She said I must be eating something I'm allergic to that I don't know about. At this point, I was starting to get annoyed because she's seen me at my absolute worst in my teenage years...she should know it's not just a superficial food allergy. I have a gajillion ointment tubes in the bathroom. She knows damn well I've been to many doctors. I told her again, it's not any specific food allergy. There are certain things that aren't good for eczema, and I avoid those. She insists it must be a food allergy and I'm being stubborn in refusing to stop eating these triggers. Then she makes a comment about my face and how ugly it is right now, and asked why I'm not trying harder to fix it. Way to kick me when I'm down. Now I'm just...insulted. I do my best. And I'm trying my best. Sometimes flare ups just happen, and she CANNOT understand how this can be. I try to tell her this and that sometimes I have to let it run its course. Especially with the weather trigger: I CAN'T CONTROL THE FUCKING WEATHER. I AM DOING MY BEST TO HANDLE THE STRESS. What I can control, I work on. Again, she doesn't understand and continues to blame me for not doing enough to eat better. I just walk away. I feel ugly and shitty enough as it is, but then to have someone point it out to you like that. Just UGHHHH. 

Anyway, to summarize: 28 years later and I've come to realize my mom has no idea what eczema is.",R

It did nothing for my hand eczema which cycled...it would flare and persist and then go into remission here and there. Overall though, to this day I battle it (ten years later). I find stress is a major factor in my flares as is wetwork--I avoid dish soap like the plague, always wear gloves. The only soap that touches my hands is my shampoo which I tolerate. I actually don't think it is a contact allergy but more about doing too much wetwork with my hands and too much exposure to chemicals.

McSwiggs,"Hi Everyone,

I hope you????€?re all doing well. I????€?m here because my life has turned somewhat upside down within the last 3 weeks. I????€?m not entirely sure what I hope to get out of this post, but perhaps an eczema sufferer that has dealt with similar characteristics can help me focus my train of thought. I do apologize for how winded this may be, but if you don????€?t mind, it will help me process all that has happened.
 
Before last week, I was a 30 year old relatively healthy male with no history of any skin-related issue, (aside from the typical puberty woes) Three weeks ago, I had an itch on my legs that wouldn????€?t go away. When I actually pulled up my pant leg to investigate the ????€?bug bite????€?, I noticed I had a long red rash that carried ?? way around my calf, right at my dress sock line. It literally looked like I had worn socks that were too tight. The odd thing is, I have almost the EXACT same marking around my other leg. Same color, general length and location (sock line, wrapped around ?? my calf). I originally thought maybe I was having a reaction to the type of fabric (I did just buy new socks????€?????€?.so much talk of socks????€?how boring????€?I????€?m sorry!). I then started to notice little red marks on the backs of both of my hands/wrists. All of these marks have been somewhat pale red, with flaky dryness on top. 
 
All that aside, I saw the dermatologist last Monday and instead of giving me some cream for a reaction I thought I was having, she instead settled on it being psoriasis. She took a biopsy and sent me on my way with some Kenalog spray and Elidel cream for my face. I called the derm office yesterday for the results and it came back that it wasn????€?t psoriasis, but instead atopic dermatitis / eczema.  I still just don????€?t understand????€?..I have read all of your horror stories regarding itching until areas bleed, losing sleep over the itchiness and pain????€?..and (by the way my heart goes out to all of you who battle this daily) I????€?m at an odd point because aside from a small itch here and there, I really haven????€?t experienced any of this. Things have both progressed in areas and also worsened in others. The original outbreak on my hands got really bad, with some large red patches forming, but they have since died down, yet more smaller red spots have popped up in other areas like my upper arms and torso. 

I guess my two main questions at this point are ????€? Is it really possible that I could be uncovering eczema at this point in my life without any issues in the past or family history????€?with a flare up that????€?s now covering a large portion of my body? Two, does Eczema always itch so badly, or does it affect individuals differently? 

I lied, third question, are there any identifiers when a flare-up is about to fade away into remission? Timeline? 
 
I just feel a little lost right now????€?????€?.and I guess I????€?m wondering if anyone has had similar eczema flare-ups.
 
Regardless, thanks for your time????€?.and apologies again for the lengthy post.

violonforte,"Scarring? Like after you trip on the pavement and get a wound on the knee and it heals - that kind of scar? Do you have pictures? Eczema doesn't typically scar because it's too superficial to recruit the scar-forming cells from the blood - unless you scratched super super strongly, enough to reach the deeper blood vessels.

I'm wondering if maybe you meant either stretch marks or skin thickening/hyperlinearity (where it looks kinda like tree bark)? If that's the case, mine never got better. Tried lots of things for stretch marks, but if it's already at the stage where it's white, scientists/doctors haven't discovered yet what will work. For the skin thickening, that's your skin's response to over-scratching. I'm not sure if it will go away either (mine never did).",R

sunflower_nat,"Hi everyone,

So just some background I????€?ve never had eczema before, my sister does have eczema but it isn????€?t Dyshidrotic. A few days ago my finger started feeling really itchy and there was a bump, this was a day after I wore a new ring (I????€?m not sure if I have a alloy allergy or not, but i????€?ve had a reaction to a earring before) and over the next couple of days it started forming blisters. So I went to the doctor and he looked at it and immediately told me it was dyshidrotic eczema, so I have my doubts because I????€?ve been doing some research online and now I????€?m really confused.

Any advice?",R
chriswasmyboy,"&gt; Not sure if it's a biologic. I can't get a lot of info yet

Thank you for sharing this information !  I am one of the patients who will be enrolling in this study shortly in New York City, that information is very encouraging to hear that you started to clear very quickly.  Please continue to update us when you start feeling significantly less itch.

Here is what I know about KHK-4083.  My dermatologist oversees the study in NY, and this is what she had to say about it.  I am paraphrasing:

The Phase 1 was done in Japan, this drug is from a Japanese company, Kyowa.  I'm not sure how many patients were enrolled in Phase 1, and I believe it was a 6 month study after which the patients were not doing any follow ups.   Each patient only received 3 injections, two weeks apart.  Starting about a month into the study, most of the patients (it could have been all, but I don't recall exactly her words) started to see their skin clear.  While there were no further injections after the initial 3 injections, the patients continued to gradually improve improve on the EASI scale all the way through until the study ended, again I believe at 6 months.  My dermatologist said this drug seemed to possibly ""reverse the disease"", and it's possible this could be a potential cure for the disease.  Again though, there was no follow up with the patients after 6 months, so it's unknown if they maintained excellent skin health beyond the study period.

In the Phase 2 just starting, this will be a 36 week study.  Patients receiving the injections will receive a total of 18 injections, 6x the amount of injections received in Phase 1.  There is a 20% chance of receiving placebo for the first 12 weeks, and those patients would still receive 8 injections.  Rescue therapy for patients with terrible conditions who receive placebo may be eligible after 8 weeks to receive the real drug.

As this is Phase 2, this drug is still quite a long way from coming to market even if it shows great results.  This is the incredibly frustrating thing about FDA studies, they take so, so long.  Upadacitinib from Abbvie showed great results in Phase 2, including for me as I was a patient in that study.  Yet, despite fantastic data and a very safe profile in both Phase 1 and Phase 2, Upadacitinib may not be approved for eczema users until 2021.  That is an outrageously long time to wait for people who have terrible eczema. I'm told Upadacitinib may be approved in mid 2020 for arthritis however, in which case it could be prescribed off label for eczema.  It would be unlikely health insurance would cover that cost however until it is actually approved for eczema, but for those who could afford to pay for the drug then it may be available in about 20 months.  Of course, it will be a super expensive drug.

mualphatautau,"I can speak from experience, but just like any other skin condition no one is 100% the same.

Me: I started getting this around age 10, starting at my palms. They would form little blistery bubbles in clumps and if I popped them, the clear liquid would dry yellow. I was definitely bad at abstaining from messing with them. Dermatologist prescribed a topical steroid, and it helped get rid of them but they would always come back. Through the years, the condition moved up to my fingers and finally, a few years, ago, to my fingertips. I would get the bubbles around my nails and at the fingertips, almost to the point to being under my nailbeds. The condition of my nails deteriorated as well, unfortunately.

Avoiding sulfates and prolonged exposure to water has helped tremendously. I'm realizing that perhaps my bout of dishydrosis is mild compared to others, but cutting out soaps and shampoos that had ingredients like sodium or ammonium laureth sulfate helped tremendously in preventing them. That, as well as keeping hands always moisturized with hand cream (I like Neutrogena's Norwegian hand cream cause it's effective, travel-friendly, and cheap) overall improved the look and feel of my hands. Other preventative lifestyle measures include wearing gloves when doing the dishes. Dish liquid is incredibly irritating, plus involves a bunch of water. Recipe for disaster. This also has helped prevent the bubbles as well as dry skin in general.

When you do have flareups, as with anything, it's imperative that you don't itch them. Easier said than done, but I know for me, it definitely worsened the flareups and the overall flareup would last longer. I suspected that I was rubbing/itching my hands during sleep, so I would wear cotton gloves to bed. They seemed to go away faster.

This might be a longshot, but when I started moisturizing with coconut oil, the condition seemed to help. After showering when skin is moist, I would moisturize all over like I would a regular lotion. You have to let it set in for about a minute or so, but it seemed to improve my skin's condition overall.",R
broccolirisotto,"Hi - I????€?m new here and it????€?s my first time posting so I apologize if I do something wrong. English is also not my first language so I????€?m sorry if some stuff comes out confusing.

Here it goes: 

I????€?m pretty sure my boyfriend has eczema. He has dry itchy patches on the inside of his elbows . It looks a lot like eczema and it????€?s now spreading to his arms and hands. 

This started about a year ago and he first thought it was an allergy. His arms started to itch out of the blue. There was nothing visible - no redness and no dryness. He tried to change everything to see if it made a difference: Soap, sheets, diet - you name it. Nothing seemed to work.

After 6 months of this itch we could see that the skin started to look very dry and a little red.
We started dating around the same time and I (thinking it was maybe also dryness) treated the patches with some occlusive moisturizers. Very simple fragrance free stuff (bephantene, cerave, Shea butter). This seemed to work really well. Around the same time we discovered he had a gluten intolerance. So after cutting gluten the patches improved a whole lot too. And since the gluten intolerance can indeed cause allergy on the skin we thought we had solve the problem.

Fast forward to January (winter) this year: his patches came back worst than ever. I think he ran out of  moisturizer in December and the patches came back racing. Now things are really really bad. He is using the moisturizers again but they don????€?t work anymore. Worst part: his patches are spreading to his hands. It itches like crazy and It hurts when the water touches his arms. He also notices a significant improvement when he doesn????€?t take a shower. 

So around February we decided it was time for him to see a doctor. 

Well... but little did we know...

We had tickets to travel to our home country this month. So we were waiting to see a doctor there. We had everything planned and l booked a doctor in our home country for this month. But now with the corona virus we had to cancel the trip and we cannot see doctors here (we are in Europe - so we are really not supposed to leave our houses or overwhelm the healthcare system with smaller issues).

So this leads me here:

I have ros??cea so I do a lot of reading about skincare issues and treatments. So I????€?m familiar with eczema because I use a lot of creams that are labeled for eczema (some stuff is recommended for both diseases - usually calming ingredients and fragrance free).
So as soon as my bf patches started looking like eczema (dry, red and swollen skin) I could tell what it was.
Normally we would go to the doctor to make sure - of course. But given the circumstances we just can????€?t.

After this madness is over we will go to a doctor to be sure our suspicions are right but we really need some tips for dealing with this in the meantime.

1.How can we stop this shit from spreading?

2.Are the moisturizers (simple fragrance free stuff) helping or making if worst?

3. Is there anything you guys recommend that we can do at home without a prescription and a proper diagnosis? I mean harmless stuff like supplements, teas or OTC creams?

The websites say soft fabrics, lukewarm water but this is really not doing the trick.

4. Actually any information would be really helpful. ????",R
drseussin,"To those who have searched high and low for some kind of relief from eczema, you might have looked into clinical trials for certain medicine. 

I am one of those people - I started Rinvoq (A JAK inhibitor) and it's done wonders for my skin. I do have minor flare-ups here and there but for the most part, no side effects. 

However, starting the first week of April, I got shingles. I used to be a healthy individual - never got sick, never had to circumvent around situations to make sure I DON'T get sick, etc. But the shingles I got, it was the worst of the worst. My doctor even said that for someone as young as me with no prior medical history should not have gotten it that bad. Even now, the first week of May, I still feel residual incredibly nerve pain where the shingles used to be. 

Somehow, my immune system got completely compromised while I was on the medication. Of course, I knew that was an option - it says so in the list of side effects. I believe it's even on a Black Label.

Anyways, moral of the story is: 

  
If you're on any kind of medication, whether it be prescribed to you or given to you through a clinical try, don't take the small notes lightly. I have always taken the fact that I was healthy for granted. Of course, I did have eczema but that did not discount my great (or, was great) immune system. Just make sure to take care of yourself by taking your vitamins, exercising, limit stress, etc. All of the basic things to boost your immune system. I didn't do that and that's probably why I got shingles as bad as it did. I wouldn't want to wish that on anybody - it was absolutely the worst pain I have felt in my entire life, no joke.

itchman,"I can tell you that the biggest hurdle to overcome is your own insecurity about your eczema (I have a daughter who has it too). When I was young I was very insecure about it, I can remember being at high school dances and before asking a girl to dance, I would stick my hands in my pockets and try to make them sweat a little so they wouldn't be so rough. Now, my wife spends a lot of time scratching me and my daughter. You'll find out that people are understanding and empathetic. Don't let it ruin your life, go do what you want to do, most people don't care, or even notice. Lots of people will ask you about it, but they are just curious. 

I'm a corporate lawyer, most of my career has not been impacted by my eczema. I've had some times in the past where it has been an issue, but everyone has things they are dealing with. You are very lucky to be born when you were. I firmly believe that eczema will be largely controlled or cured over the next decade. Most of my life there were no real answers for it and no real treatments other than steroids, but in the last 2 years alone there have been more advancements in eczema treatment than I saw in 30 years.

ahhhnonono,"""Loss-of-function"" refers to the filaggrin gene, which codes for a protein, filaggrin, which is a major structural component of skin, cross-linking keratin in the stratum corneum to make a good barrier to bacteria etc, and acting as an antibacterial in its break-down products. Some people with eczema inherit a variant of this gene which is makes misshapen filaggrin which doesn't work properly. This is one gene implicated in eczema, as it has been found in many people with eczema and their relatives (eczema is highly heritable). There are other genes implicated too (eczema is a condition which can have different causes), and they appear to code for structural and/or anti-bacterial components of the skin too. So there's no ""triggering"" of the loss-of-function, it's inherited - and there's the thing - in families where one child gets eczema and the other kids don't, they all eat the same diet as a family, but the one kids get eczema - what's the difference ? That kid's inherited the problem gene.
There has been no significant research into the epigenetics of eczema yet, but it's an interesting area.

Aren't you just pushing your book ? You say you're 29 and have found a cure for eczema - well, if I'd found a cure for eczema, which had somehow evaded that world's best researchers, I would publish that information for free as a paper as I never want anyone to go through what I've been through and I could never make money out of that - I think it's disgraceful.",R

SociopathicAmbition,"Mederma PM cream for the scarring, Cortisone 10 Max strength Eczema lotion (the one that has the cap on the bottom and a purple label that says eczema) for healing during the day, and CeraVe ointment to keep the raw skin moisturized. At night clean hands and apply Mederma to the most raw and scabbed portions, wait for it to dry for about 10-20 minutes, then apply thick layer of CeraVe and sit on the couch for like 20 minutes because in my experience if you goto bed with a thick layer of newly applied ointment you'll end up opening the scars and causing more harm. The Cortisone is applied just the same way as the Maderma with clean hands but a shorter drying time, then a decent layer of CeraVe. You must stay strong especially at night and not itch while you're awake. Cut your nails so short that the tips of your fingers feel naked. Clean your bedding, and put your sheets in the dryer every couple of days on normal to get rid of the dead skin. This is coming from a lot of experience, all of this is important to stick to if you want to heal as fast as I can.
