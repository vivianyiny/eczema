31,a far a i know prednisone is a steroid that used to reduce inflammation throughout the body so not just for eczema the only time i ve been prescribed it wa when i had a really bad flare up to manage it and get it under control with conventional measure steroid cream etc,1,1,1
32,not a problem i ve only used steroid short term a few time it s been a few year since the last time but my tsw symptom weren t terrible i just got really flaky and red itchy and a bit irritated too yes the experience wa horrible but it eventually went away,1,1,1

63,hey ulta employee with severe eczema here i ve struggled with the same issue so here s what i do on the daily to be able to wear makeup at work first skincare is going to be so important every morning i wash my face with a sensitive skin brush head on my clarisonic the bristle are soft so they don t irritate my skin but the friction is enough to gently get off all the flakiness that pop up overnight after that i use my favorite moisturizer s lately i ve been starting with a gel based moisturizer clinique hour moisture surge to penetrate deep into the skin and then i ll use something much thicker on top la roche posay lipkar balm is my absolute favorite you can use what you know work for you after that i ll warm up some ointment in my palm lately i ve been using aquaphor because it s cheap and concentrate that on the part of my face that flake up for me that s on my forehead the side of my nose and my jaw and neck second makeup prep i like to use the too faced hangover primer all over my face and then go in with the hydrating porefessional by benefit the porefessional is really great at smoothing texture and the hyaluronic acid in it pull moisture throughout the day a little go a long way finally i use a thick cream my friend gave me a vanicream sample and that ha been so amazing and place it on the area of my face that flake up i know this is a lot of prep but i work hour shift and without this routine i m a flakey mess by the end of it i can say without a doubt that this routine ha helped me so much after the prep do your makeup a normal but i do have a few tip to reduce irritation first do your base makeup with a clean sponge instead of brush this is a lot gentler on damaged skin it prevents micro tearing and the spread of bacteria second don t be afraid to set your face just do so lightly do not bake gently press in any powder product third be gentle with brush around the eye for obvious reason i firmly believe that everyone deserves to be comfortable in their makeup you deserve to feel beautiful i know it can be really hard sometimes i get stuck in the trap of comparing myself to others every day it s not worth it you re a baddie even on the bad day good luck,1,1,1
64,ayyy i like this company lmao i did the same allergy thing you have but it wasn t working too well for me so hopefully they figure it all out,1,1,1
65,i notice that i ll break out worse after i put thing on it to try to calm it down i ve noticed petroleum based or anything oily based will cause reaction some time even lotion it s a very hopeless feeling a it already miserable enough going through an outbreak let alone not be able to do anything to remedy it ha anyone else had this happen,1,1,1
66,the camera make it look far le awful edit just needed to clean my lens,0,1,1
67,what is it exactly you ve been using i have the same thing but it s a lot more severe and on my entire hand,1,1,1
68,i saw on amazon you can buy pure raw shea butter cocoa butter etc and i wa wondering about making my own lotion i ve never done anything of the sort but i can t imagine it would be that hard it d be like baking then i know what go into it if it doesn t help i probably wouldn t have spent much more than buying a product from a store thought edit another question have any of you guy tried cocoa butter i can t find anything about using it for eczema and i wa wondering if it s worth trying,1,1,1
69,it varies a great deal the worst case scenario are most visible but i m a case where i started noticing a tolerance for steroid suspect that some of my eczema wa caused entirely by the steroid quit using them month ago and have had only moderate withdrawal symptom it wa a couple of week of bad itch but now i m managing my eczema without steroid and it s constantly improving,1,1,1
70,gt blepharitis oh wow that suck honestly i thought eczema got better in warmer climate when i moved up north usa i had flare up but when i wa in the south usa i literally had maybe one outbreak and didn t need topical ointment thats a really great perspective tho i wouldn t have thought that,1,1,1

88,i know i m a bit late but neosporin make an anti itch cream in a oz tube that always help me when i get cracked and flaked skin due to eczema i feel like it combine the best of all world moisturizes heals and protects against infection,1,1,1

95,conspiracy dermatologist and skin care company are making billion on eczema so there will be no cure anytime soon,1,1,1
96,in the u in my state a dermatologist can have either an md or a do after their name but yes they are just a much of an insurance covered medical professional a your primary care physician they are just specialized in the field of dermatology you should be able to call the number on the back of your insurance card to find a dermatologist in your area that your insurance considers in network my insurance provider anthem ha a find a provider feature on their website where you can search by all kinda of variable such a location specialty language spoken etc whether or not you need a referral depends on your specific insurance company plan just give them a call and ask,1,1,1

104,he s a doctor that help you remotely he s based in cape town south africa but help people all around the world he specializes in eczema google him,1,1,1
105,i also just started taking fish oil but can t tell a difference yet i ve had eczema my entire life so i m pretty lazy with trying to deal with it since it always come back but for this type i try to keep my hand extremely dry in order to dry the blister out your hand then can become cracked or have obvious dry skin buildup but once the blister lower putting on lotion or ointment doesn t burn and seems to actually heal the skin that s my experience anyway,1,1,1
106,im eating fresh raw half my local market cut them up in half for cent i eat two half inch slice in the evening and the next morning my eczema patch almost look back to normal,1,1,1
107,so glad they worked for you difference between night and day sound amazing i m afraid year of weekly then monthly shot hardly worked for my eczema maybe a little helpful for my allergy induced asthma my serum wa for dust mite which are everywhere and cat though i stay the hell away from them protopic every other day is how i m managing along with daily anti histamine and asmanex for the asthma,1,1,1
108,i can speak from experience but just like any other skin condition no one is the same me i started getting this around age starting at my palm they would form little blistery bubble in clump and if i popped them the clear liquid would dry yellow i wa definitely bad at abstaining from messing with them dermatologist prescribed a topical steroid and it helped get rid of them but they would always come back through the year the condition moved up to my finger and finally a few year ago to my fingertip i would get the bubble around my nail and at the fingertip almost to the point to being under my nailbeds the condition of my nail deteriorated a well unfortunately avoiding sulfate and prolonged exposure to water ha helped tremendously i m realizing that perhaps my bout of dishydrosis is mild compared to others but cutting out soap and shampoo that had ingredient like sodium or ammonium laureth sulfate helped tremendously in preventing them that a well a keeping hand always moisturized with hand cream i like neutrogena s norwegian hand cream cause it s effective travel friendly and cheap overall improved the look and feel of my hand other preventative lifestyle measure include wearing glove when doing the dish dish liquid is incredibly irritating plus involves a bunch of water recipe for disaster this also ha helped prevent the bubble a well a dry skin in general when you do have flareups a with anything it s imperative that you don t itch them easier said than done but i know for me it definitely worsened the flareups and the overall flareup would last longer i suspected that i wa rubbing itching my hand during sleep so i would wear cotton glove to bed they seemed to go away faster this might be a longshot but when i started moisturizing with coconut oil the condition seemed to help after showering when skin is moist i would moisturize all over like i would a regular lotion you have to let it set in for about a minute or so but it seemed to improve my skin s condition overall,1,1,1

114,my kiddo is currently itching her foot under a blanket in hope i don t see her scratching and ask her to stop after browsing r eczema i thought y all might have some advice on how to prevent the breakout instead of just treating she get it on her hand and foot and it take about a week for resinol to clear it up the dermatologist prescribed her eucrisa she used it for about month but she still had flair ups she ha been allergy tested and isn t allergic to anything we have moved time since the eczema started all very different environment one of those move our household good stayed in storage and the kid and i stayed with family so i can rule out environmental factor she take some fancy kid supplement amp probiotic my crunchy pediatrician mom friend recommended i think those might have helped slightly but i m not sure the only thing that knock it out is resinol but i would really like to figure how to stop the frequency of the flairups any advice would be appreciated,1,1,1
115,oh that make sense it seems like there s probably a way to taper off so that you re going off the steroid a you ramp up the uvb treatment and you might not have to deal with anything too bad in the in between,1,1,1
116,this in fact is a huge issue which the vast majority of people do know hence why i a a chemist do not recommend jar and totally dislike stick dispensed product tube all the way,1,1,1
117,ha anyone tried this a an anti itch it might be just a rumour but if it did work i d advocate it to be legal in the uk because i m in dire need of a safe local anaesthetic,1,1,1
118,tore up reading this i m really sorry i have severe eczema and i ve had it my entire life growing up i still struggle with it every single damn day my mom and dad love me so much and every day they would say we wish we had eczema instead of you your love for your kid make a world of a difference i still enjoy my life a much a i would without eczema because of my parent friend and peer hopefully your son grows out of it like some people do what doesn t kill you make you stronger,1,1,1
119,thank you,0,0,0
120,i m not getting into a pissing match over who s got worse skin i know about painful eczema i wa signed off work with due to the pain so i can both sympathise and empathise with you all i wa saying wa that opiate cause itching and otc is safer they are otc because they are safer,1,1,1

124,i ve been diagnosed with dishydrotic eczema about a month ago and i am so miserable they prescribed me some ointment but it s not doing anything i bought some cream at target and some anti itch stuff and nothing is working on me i dont care about these ugly blister but i cannot stand the itch i getso itchy and then my hand are just burning i work in a nail salon so i thinkone of the chemical used there ha started this on top of that my state just had a bad storm and i ve been without power for day so my house is hot and muggywhich is causing worse flair ups any advice would help i m so over this,1,1,1
125,i felt this way too i will say though that that shouldn t stop you from pursing the thing you love and looking for people to connect with i opened up to my girlfriend pretty early on mo about my eczema and my self image and lack of self love because of it and she said i love you and this is your skin so i love your skin we talked the rest of the night about it and it really broke me out of my self loathing treat your condition but make sure you re also treating the person under that skin well too,1,1,1
126,i use cerave foaming face wash in the shower and yes to tomato charcoal scrub a well then after the shower i use yes to cucumber primer moisturizer if the yes to brand react with your skin funny cerave make a moisturizer too,1,1,1
127,i don t type for a living but perhaps a le greasy hand cream or a more concentrated cream and only apply it to the affected patch,1,1,1
128,hmm ok not that long i can t see ur skin but just google topical steroid withdrawal and flaking and just look at the picture and see if it s is similar,1,1,1
129,you can certainly try that the thing is and you ll see on here everyone s eczema reacts a little differently what might work perfectly for one person won t do a thing for you lol that s the fun part of this haha i would wash it well with your soap let it dry don t rub it with a towel blot it dry with a paper towel or just let it air dry and then apply some moisturizer i use amlactin because i m not allergic to it but it s quite expensive aveeno is a great affordable brand that a lot of people use my trick for keeping myself from scratching them is to keep my fingernail cut a short a possible and filed to nice round edge so i have nothing to scratch with that s especially useful when i m sleeping and don t have conscious control over the itching,1,1,1
130,you should talk to your bos about this i feel like,0,0,0
131,thanks i will have a look at that one,0,0,0
132,i ve been trying to keep a food diary but nothing is sticking out to me i don t know how long it would take for me to react to something and it doesn t seem to be anything within a day,1,1,1

134,i would like to stress that parabens are not a big bad and most people are fine with it however if your curel cream doesn t help for you maybe try switching to a paraben free alternative for a week or two and see if it help no harm in trying,1,1,1
135,duuuuude i am sick constantly,0,0,0
136,i had something similar when i wa a teenager i had blepharitis probably also eczema because there were time when the skin wa flaky on top of the terrible inflammation amp x b i recommend tcm to anyone with eye area eczema blepharitis etc because it wa the only thing which worked for me i had blepharitis which ha a lot of similarity with eczema on eyelid when i wa a teenager and only month of drinking traditional chinese med herb prescribed by a tcm practioner boiled in a pot of water applying warm compress small towel soaked in the med made it go away i haven t had a relapse since just the occasional itchy eye that eyelid bump thing a couple time a year which go away in a few day after i use eyewash and eye drop drinking the very bitter med also helped my hand arm back of the knee eczema go away at that time the clinic doctor gave me terramycin and erythromycin and whatnot and they were all terrible none of them had effect lasting for longer than a day many of the ointment actually made thing worse even the pigmentation went away so now i just have dark eye circle because of my terrible sleep schedule lol honestly tcm treatment from someone who know what they re doing can help so much if you know of a good tcm practitioner it s worth a shot for the long term and the good thing is that you can usually use tcm in conjunction with western medicine without the two interfering btw using eyewash might also help your eye area feel get better unless your skin hate witch hazel or something cleaner eye area better recovery i use optrex a it doesn t irritate my eye at all some of the other brand had a stinging burning sensation which wa deeply unpleasant if you buy optrex i would advise you to buy the small bottle if you re not using it multiple time per day or else you ll find yourself having a lot of leftover one month later and having to throw it out because eye product can t be kept for long once opened another thing i also did wa to put a small amount of eyewash on a soft cotton pad and gently wipe my eye area when it feel uncomfortable you could also buy eyelid wipe i ve tried a brand called systane but i didn t like it a much a the eyewash on cotton pad method but they re very convenient if you re outside the systane wipe also smelled like almond milk for some incomprehensible reason,1,1,1
137,these tip are really helpful thanks i already use these soap i did an allergy test but nothing interesting came out i had a very mild reaction to grass and early year tree i can relate on the part with the doorknob going to the toilet is hell even knowing you re going to have to wash your hand after that,1,1,1
138,thanks i ll try that,0,0,0
139,i ll look into the allergy testing i hadn t thought of that i have adhd so i know i wouldn t be able to consistently keep a journal on it lol but i likely will have to go back to all super sensitive soap and shampoo temporarily until everything clear up,1,1,1
140,i get a prescription from my gp or derm i believe one brand is deltasone but not sure on any others,1,1,1
141,you need to go to a regular dermatologist there s lot they can do to help you don t need to suffer you can be on a limited course of steroid cream to get your skin under control and then move to something else there are also non steroid option like tacrolimus to try this is another idea,1,1,1
142,wrap some medical tape around the crack,1,0,1
143,doe it matter if i spend a lot of money on brand name vitamin or spend a lot le money and get target brand vitamin or will they both provide the same use i m going to start taking a lot of vitamin and can t afford to get all brand name and want to see if it is worth it to get target brand,1,1,1

146,i started using flaxseed oil supplement and i feel very optimistic but it s only been a couple of day,1,1,1
147,preface i know you guy can t diagnose me also i have seen a dermatologist but he wa pretty clueless and had terrible review which i saw after seeing him i have dry red skin to the side of my nose on my forehead and a little under my lip i don t think it s eczema because i literally don t feel it at all i always read about how eczema itch s so much and that some people have pain or feel uncomfortable my skin feel completely normal but just doesn t look it,1,1,1
148,nope i m not super strict anymore at first for a few week i stuck to the diet and i took load of vitamin c which is suppose to help negate nickel absorption my eczema went away fairly quickly maybe a couple week i ve now added in some legume i love peanut butter but i have learned soy dark chocolate and oat are a total no go also shaving brings my eczema back so i get waxed my armpit just have to be itchy because i hate letting the hair grow out now if i start to get a bit itchy i go back to for a few day good luck,1,1,1
149,the dermatologist thought the pimple like red sore were a complicated mix of eczema and folliculitis will the sore come back,1,1,1
150,keep the moisturising grind going bro,1,0,1
151,i m really glad it helped you though lt,0,1,1
152,exactly i wa done spending load of money for something that would eventually stop working healing really doe come from the inside out,1,1,1
153,i used to use steroid cream on my face to get rid of it especially on my forehead but have now switched to aveeno skin relief with shea butter i put a good amount of this on my face at night before bed and a soon a i come out of the shower it keep the moisture in without looking greasy and i suspect it s the oatmeal in it that make the redness go away a few day after a flare up hot shower are definitely something to be avoided a much a possible i shower with the water lukewarm and wash my face with cold water although not so cold a to be uncomfortable hot water may get rid of the itch and that first dry layer but will still be drying out the healthy skin underneath which may not be obvious at first but will eventually peel causing the cycle to continue,1,1,1
154,christmas haul lt,0,0,0
155,honestly i ve found that vaseline make my eczema far far worse anything petroleum based really especially my dishydrotic eczema coconut oil work for some people but i found it wa too abrasive for me and didn t help either maybe try a good warm shower and then a light application of tea tree oil to dry the weeping witch hazel sound like it s probably a good idea but it usually ha an alcohol base which can exacerbate eczema a well and then a light moisturizer cortizone make a really nice lotion now for eczema that is cheap and you can find pretty much anywhere you can apply the tea tree by soaking a towel first and patting it on to avoid over doing it it can be over drying if used in large amount also avoid any laundry detergent with dye or fragrance if you don t already i had mono once and my dishydrotic eczema decided to spread to my face and neck for like month so i know how you feel and it s horrible,1,1,1
156,hey welcome to the club i ve been living with eczema in both ear for year now ignored it until it started weeping and itching like crazy ent gave me cortisone cream and drop that don t do much but if i just carefully apply baby lotion with qtips it help a ton,1,1,1
157,i sweat at the slightest temperature increase and have to be cold when i sleep i love summer though because my skin heals up during the season i totally get the needing to strip when entering a warm building from being cold i hate the sticky feeling i get after a few minute in a warm building it feel like i m standing in a hot oven while everyone else is talking about still being chilly,1,1,1
158,i m sorry i just had something similar happen to me a doctor once told me that insurance company will cover one size but not another depending on the size of tube you may be able to get a better deal so it may be cheaper to get two small tube than one large tube if your insurance cover the smaller tube if you ask your pharmacy to run through the other tube size you might be able to get a better deal good luck,1,1,1
159,hi my baby wa the same way and she is now six and despite all of the doctor telling me she would outgrow it it rage on her symptom are stress and heat related with also a mild grass allergy that make it worse on occasion first thing i would do in your case is get some scratch sleeve with silk mitt for when the child is asleep so they don t go at it at night and make everything worse i ordered mine online get into a routine of giving bath with oatmeal or epsom salt try both to figure out what you prefer get stocked on several high quality lotion for daily use we use cetaphil restoraderm twice a day all over her body plus a tub of thick eucerin for trouble spot throughout the day i would read these sub for other recommendation it s different for everyone and there are lot of brand to try for really bad flare ups i use protopic or a mild steroid right when i see spot starting to come out if i get it before it s full blown i only have to use the big gun for a couple of day and then i just go back to the regular routine i hate using them at all but sometimes it s the only way to get it to stop and with kid they don t know how to handle it without scratching like crazy i don t know a long a you use with precaution day on day off only at night with protopic to avoid sunlight exposure it s ok lastly get an appointment with a dermatologist who specialized in eczema my pediatrician a lovely woman put u through hell with elimination diet and buying new all of this special organic food and clothing and within two minute of seeing the specialist he said yeah that only work in a very small amount of people most likely for you it s genetic yes and related to heat and stress yes i could be different for you but before going through all the effort of eliminating gluten or sugar try to figure out your kid s trigger good luck some kid really do outgrow it but even if they don t there are a lot of great product out there to make it bearable the hard part is sifting through it all to figure out the right combination for your kid,1,1,1
160,i m from the philippine actually what clinic did you go to i want to get my leg lasered after the lockdown i m just worried about the price because my financial capacity is really constrained did you get diode or ipl,1,1,1

163,try using lot of gentle scent free lotion on your entire body lotion will ad a barrier of protection to your skin stop using soap and scent also change your diet to a eczema friendly diet and use a antihistamine for the itching,1,1,1

169,i don t see enough about hard water on this sub it s not a cheap thing if you don t have it but a water softener is an incredible thing when you have eczema i hadn t had a flair up in over year but when i moved into my new apartment the hard water did a number on me ended up turning into a full blown flair up thats lasted month i reached out to my landlady though and she wa incredibly nice and had a softener installed and after two week of waiting for the installation i took my first comfortable shower in month today i had been experiencing the same thing a you incredibly dry even after moisturizing after the shower right now though i feel so much better i can t stress enough how much of a difference it make,1,1,1

181,i just wanted to share this to show it s important to know about literally anything and everything that is touching your skin i d also recommend highly to see an allergist if you have not already it ha helped me immensely in figuring out that i do have allergy to certain thing and then how to manage those i wa in my mid to late s when i finally went and saw one against my derms recommendation she said she only recommends it if you re a kid but if you ve never been to one in your life why not my skin wa the worst it had ever been until i saw my allergist now it s the best it s ever been anyway to the story i posted on here about a month ago about tip for dyshidrosis in the web of my finger i don t typically get that type of eczema very often even though it s winter now so i thought it wa strange i ve been trying the curly girl method for my hair and have been trying different product i purchased vo shampoo and had been using it for over a month or so i always check the ingredient but somehow missed that all of these shampoo have the dreaded methylchloroisothiazolinone i immediately stopped using these and my hand were much improved by just one day of not using that shampoo hopefully this help some of you in some way,1,1,1

189,burning and itching are two of the most common side effect with tacrolimus ointment they usually disappear after a few application,1,1,1
190,i d say explore a few alternative you probably have to change your approach really sound horrible for you at the moment but if it s not working i generally think it s time to change antibiotic short term answer obviously a few option immunosuppressant low dosage of methotrexate work for my eczema took about month to actually become effective possible dietary change wet wrap twice a day there are some heavy tar based prescription product safe contains no steroid like cocois which may be effective for your kneck there are lot of approach to take with eczema we all have different type trigger story etc but i kinda see it a a journey where we have to go through a trial and error proccess with the everlasting hope we will finally find something that work for all the people on this with horror story and incurable eczema there are far more who have found thing that have worked for them and seen great improvement be optimistic don t be hard on yourself speak with your dermatologist maybe look into any one of the option i mentioned above and i m sure you will find a system that work good luck,1,1,1
191,i ve used it for a year nonstop with the high end desoxymethazone stuff and didn t have any withdrawl symptom when i switched to just using eucerin i really feel like the withdrawl thing is another one of those alt medicine circlejerks perpetuated by these site fishing for pageviews,1,1,1

201,hi guy just wanted to share with you guy how eliminating nightshade from my diet ha helped me before i found out about this diet i literally lived on nightshade i loved eating tomato and bell pepper because of how easy it is to cook my favourite soup had tomato and potato in it so it wa incredibly hard for me to start this diet at first it doe get easier though i ve been on this diet for a little more than a month now and i ve got to say that it s been helping i still get flare ups from time to time because i m really allergic to dust mite and my accommodation ha carpeted floor so it s basically impossible to keep the dust out of my room plus i also smoke tobacco belongs in the nightshade family too unfortunately haha so i think that s kinda been keeping me back a little i also have the occasional mcdonalds meal so i end up eating fry hehe but yea i ve also included picture of before and after the diet which you can see here the before picture wa taken at literally the worst time of my life it hurt to even move my arm and the eczema started to spread to my face i wa really depressed and anxious about it because you know eczema s just not a very good look you can still see it didn t completely leave after i started the diet but it s been so much better,1,1,1

208,r dyshidrosis look like this it s what i have,1,0,0
209,this wa my reply to another post about two different cream steroid ointment and i think this may give you some idea it depends where you apply them they work for me it also depends on how the condition of the spot is for instance if my finger are oozing liquid then elocon work but if my face is oozing then protopic work but if my face ha eczema without oozing liquid then elocon work,1,1,1

250,also worked in a dental office also have contact dermatitis my hand got really bad after i started and couldn t figure it out ended up being a contact allergy to the glove and soap i wa using i m also allergic to leather lol you probably have a contact allergy to these thing hence why when you d sweat the tanning chemical from your leather glove would soak onto your hand and cause you issue i would suggest patch testing at a derm office to figure out the specific compound you need to avoid it ha helped me immensely they even gave me a contact allergy app to see what product i can use,1,1,1
251,god haha the cream is mostly dried out but it still work that stuff is amazing i found a really old one once said it wa expired but it worked,1,1,1
252,i recently had a girl round and we wa in bed i kept my distance and refrained from scratching and felt sick and sweaty all night i hated it but i want someone in my life but if it going to be like that forever is it even worth it,1,1,1
253,it worked a more of a last resort and worked way better than a course of antibiotic or steroid at my worst i think i wa doing it once a month it just killed all the bug that where causing the itching and the rest managed by the diluted steroid cream diluted with aqueous cream so it worked a a moisturiser and helped spread the steroid more evenly,1,1,1
254,i m at week pretty sure i m on the placebo a well i found my first set of injection actually helped i saw slight improvement my skin is slightly smoother but still itchy a hell i m about covered not much improvement past few week though i can t wait for the open label,1,1,1
255,wow i never would have thought that there s a bubble mask out there that can be used on sensitive skin it seemed like a normal skin type sort of thing i ll look into these i see on the vanicream situation it seems like the only thing that help some people will look into further review of the benton product thanks for taking the time to write all this advice cent out i really appreciate your thoughtful effort xx,1,1,1
256,so glad i could help i think nars ha a pretty good shade selection a well so i hope you find one that work for you haven t tried cover fx drop yet no is that more of a tinted moisturiser type deal i would love to wear those because i love the look but unfortunately i get patch of really bad redness that i need heavier coverage for,1,1,1

259,isn t it sick that company put sl into our soap and shampoo and sl in the lab is used to induce irritation and itchiness,1,1,1
260,i second everyone here that ha suggested something cold that always help take a little bit of that hot inflammation down my doctor told me i could do a bleach bath to see if it would help i haven t done it yet so i can t vouch for it efficacy i would ask your doctor or do some research before trying it though i know it s a controversial topic sometimes,1,1,1
261,i have extreme eczema on my hand and wrist most of the time my hand are bandaged i ve tried everything but i ve been dry brushing for about a month and it s gone and i haven t bandaged my hand for a couple week for those who don t know what dry brushing is you use a natural bristle brush that is about the size of your hand you can find them at natural food store mine ha a long handle on it to make it easier to get your back synthetic bristle are too harsh for skin right before you shower gently brush your skin starting at your foot always single stroke towards your heart from what i understand this help the circulation of your lymphatic system to help rid of toxin i recommend researching to get a more detailed explanation and instruction definitely drink lot of water after dry brushing to help flush toxin out of your body before they settle somewhere else cucumber amp lemon juice is an added help in removing toxin i had only dry brushed for about a week when i started noticing a difference i avoided brushing my painful patch for a while until my wound were healed enough to brush them a bit i would definitely recommend trying this out,1,1,1
262,avoid soap i suggest a body wash instead aveeno ha a good one or don t use soap in that area at all,1,1,1
263,thanks man for the time you spend replying all this eczema is new to me a i have just begun to flare up over the last month or two i m still going through the phase of buying lotion and supplement and i plan to do a whole new food diet regimen in the new year once the thanksgiving and christmas feasting ha ended right now i am using a new topical steroid cream duobrii prescribed my my derm but it doe seem to do nothing really over the last two week i might try one leg continuing with the steroid and the other with the new cream coming tomorrow or maybe just do both fuck it anyway i will let you know how it go,1,1,1
264,the skin thinning will heal over time if you have discontinued over usage of steroid my arm and hand were so thin it wa like playing with play dough but they have gotten better and are like almost normal skin again a for dupixent if you are in the usa it is hell to get onto with insurance id find a allergist immunologist who willing to go through all the medication you have to try before you can apply and hopefully get approved to get into the dupixent myway program and be able to have your insurance approve it until then try to find what cause your eczema cuz sometimes you can figure it out dust cat dog milk stress and try to eliminate those thing because even if it doesn t do shit to help right away it will help in the long run by putting le strain on your body idk recently i cut out drinking milk and keep an eye on how much sugar i consume and flare have been maybe once a day instead of constantly im on dupixent so i don t know if this will help you since i ve since forgotten how my eczema acted before i went on it but let it dry out it is in my opinion more bareable to be dry and uncomfortable then inflamed and in pain might be another reason for le flare dupixent unfortunately isn t a cure all but better drug similar to it are coming delayed by the pandemic d in the future and thats what keep me going ive become allergic to dupixent like this really cool oral medication that take the itching away or a drug like dupixent where you inject it but it doesn t have the eye problem that dupixent can cause thats whats happening to me idk how to help with the gf thing i luckily met my gf before my eczema went to hell sometimes i think im allergic to her but shes stuck around for the past year of mine being absolute hell even if all my eyebrow fell out and my face skin shed off weekly so just keep searching or be optimistic there are people who look past how you are physically i think i have gotten to the point in my own eczema journey i also wa born with it where i have accepted it won t get better and all i can do is try to make it live able and it hurt accepting that but my doctor ha said to me i don t know how you can be so patient waiting for thing to get better and it because i don t think they will get better so it make it easier on me when they actually do or don t if i have no expectation so i can t get disappointed when something doesn t work idk if that s healthy but thats just what i do keep your chin up we all out here suffering separately but together but once you turn that pure rage and hatred twords it into something else it really help mentally because this disorder is so mentally draining but don t let it kick you while your down fight back i hope you can find what work and help you cope with it also finding a doc who give a shit help a hell of a lot try to look for a different one if you can,1,1,1
265,a prescription shampoo wa the only thing that helped me shampoo only minimize the itchiness and flakiness,1,1,1
266,that s one of my least favorite because for me it s just a slippery slope i get to there and wake up the next day with it all over and can t really control it after that,0,1,1
267,hi everyone i hope you re all doing well i m here because my life ha turned somewhat upside down within the last week i m not entirely sure what i hope to get out of this post but perhaps an eczema sufferer that ha dealt with similar characteristic can help me focus my train of thought i do apologize for how winded this may be but if you don t mind it will help me process all that ha happened before last week i wa a year old relatively healthy male with no history of any skin related issue aside from the typical puberty woe three week ago i had an itch on my leg that wouldn t go away when i actually pulled up my pant leg to investigate the bug bite i noticed i had a long red rash that carried way around my calf right at my dress sock line it literally looked like i had worn sock that were too tight the odd thing is i have almost the exact same marking around my other leg same color general length and location sock line wrapped around my calf i originally thought maybe i wa having a reaction to the type of fabric i did just buy new sock so much talk of sock how boring i m sorry i then started to notice little red mark on the back of both of my hand wrist all of these mark have been somewhat pale red with flaky dryness on top all that aside i saw the dermatologist last monday and instead of giving me some cream for a reaction i thought i wa having she instead settled on it being psoriasis she took a biopsy and sent me on my way with some kenalog spray and elidel cream for my face i called the derm office yesterday for the result and it came back that it wasn t psoriasis but instead atopic dermatitis eczema i still just don t understand i have read all of your horror story regarding itching until area bleed losing sleep over the itchiness and pain and by the way my heart go out to all of you who battle this daily i m at an odd point because aside from a small itch here and there i really haven t experienced any of this thing have both progressed in area and also worsened in others the original outbreak on my hand got really bad with some large red patch forming but they have since died down yet more smaller red spot have popped up in other area like my upper arm and torso i guess my two main question at this point are is it really possible that i could be uncovering eczema at this point in my life without any issue in the past or family history with a flare up that s now covering a large portion of my body two doe eczema always itch so badly or doe it affect individual differently i lied third question are there any identifier when a flare up is about to fade away into remission timeline i just feel a little lost right now and i guess i m wondering if anyone ha had similar eczema flare ups regardless thanks for your time and apology again for the lengthy post,1,1,1
268,i use it for hair care to moisture my scalp and hair but also on my partner who suffers from eczema i am trying to find an alternative because it is quite expensive did you try different brand,1,1,1

273,i m actually in the middle of a trial now my first injection wa almost a month ago now and my next is this week i m reasonably certain i didn t roll the placebo the odds were in my favour this time at and i ve noticed a significant decrease in overall and incidental itchiness although i unfortunately still flare up occasionally often linked to sweat and or stress this could however be attributed to an environmental shift i m le prone to outdoor seasonal allergy in the winter and one downside is that there hasn t been an obvious improvement on my skin actually being dry and flaky i m sure that scratching le ha helped indirectly though i m based in southern ontario canada and am m feel free to pm or reply if you ve got any other question,1,1,1
274,no bread at all,1,0,0
275,i d like to get another doctor but my mom ha a strong bias for this one and she think she did very good with my diagnosis today which is b the only good advice she gave wa to use lotion that s about it,1,1,1
